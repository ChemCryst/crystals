    <h1>General Refinement Strategies</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="c1">
    <h2>The Overall Scale Factor</h2>
  </div>The overall scale factor converts the observed values of the structure amplitudes
  from the arbitary experimental scale (which depends upon the instrument, sample size,
  exposure time etc etc) to a scale of electrons.<br />
  An reasonable initial estimate can usually be obtained for molecular structures from
  the Wilson Plot. For inorganic structures (where the underlying statistical assumptions
  may not be met) the estimate may be unreliable. Verify that the Wilson Plot looks
  reasonable.<br />
  <img src="../analyse/Wilson.jpg" /><br />
  If an external program is successful in more or less solving the structure,this can be
  input into CRYSTALS and used to compute an approximate overall scale factor.<br />
  The overall scale factor is very highly correlated with the adps (temperature factors).
  If an attempt is made to refine the adps with a hopelessly wrong scale factor, in the
  first cycle of refinement the adps may take on such improbable values that the
  refinement will diverge rather than converge.<br />
  <br />
  <small>The least squares procedure tries to make Fo equal to Fc by adjusting the model
  (which changes Fc) and changing the scale factor (which in effect changes Fo). The
  program is organised so that normally these changes co-exist and conserve a reasonable
  model and a reasonable scale factor. However, if the program goes out side of its range
  of stability, Fc can be made to approach zero by making the adps large, and Fo can also
  be made to approach zero by making the scale factor very small. We then have the
  trivial solution that Fo is approximately equal to Fc is approximately equal to zero.
  If this starts to happen, the refinement will get out of control. Once the adps become
  very large (i.e. Fc is very small), there is no leverage on the atomic positions and
  the structure will "blow up".</small>

  <div class="c1">
    <h2>Refinement Strategy</h2>
  </div>If a whole structure or recognisable fragment is available (perhaps from Direct
  Methods) CRYSTALS will use this to compute an initial scale factor and R-factor. Based
  on this value, the program will then try to select an appropriate next action. Possible
  actions are listed in order of increasing model complexity. You can move
  backwards/forwards in this list if you disagree with the automatic choice.

  <ul>
    <li>Refine the scale factor.<br />
    This is normally done automatically when you input a model structure, but you might
    want to re-do it if you use manually make substantial changes to the structure,
    perhaps via the model window or by the model building options.</li>

    <li>Refine the atomic positions.<br />
    It is possible to guess approximate values for isotropic adps (e.g. 0.05
    A<sup>2</sup> at room temperature, smaller at lower temperatures). Leaving the adps
    unrefined at reasonable values enables the least squares to optimise the
    positions.</li>

    <li>Refine positions and Uiso<br />
    Once the positions are stable, it is safe to allow the isotropic adps to refine. This
    is an important stage in assessing the correctness of the structure. If a few adps
    refine to unusually small values, it is possible that the atoms should be changed to
    an element with a higher atomic number. If all/most of the atoms refine to unusually
    small values, this suggests that the absorption correction is inadequate. Recall that
    the theta dependence of the correction cannot be computed from multi-scan data. You
    will need to have provided your absorption correction program with an approximate
    size of the crystal and approximate empirical formula.</li>

    <li>Refine positions and anisotropic adps<br />
    Once the isotropic adps have been seen to be satisfactory it is safe to refine the
    anisotropic adps. A few unusually elongated ellipses may suggest disordered atoms
    (CRYSTALS will output a suggestion about this). If most of the adps are elongated or
    compresses in the same direction this may indicate issues with the absorption
    correction, or severe truncation of the data collection in one direction.</li>

    <li>Sticky Settings<br />
    Normally all the non-hydrogen atoms are refined in the same way, but occasionally you
    may need to treat individual atoms in a different way. <i>Sticky</i> refinement
    requirement can be set via the model window. These will normally take precedence over
    automatic treatment.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="c1">
    <h2>Hydrogen Atom Treatment</h2>
  </div>This is discussed at some length in this <a href="refine-h.html">HELP</a>
  file.<br />
  If most of the hydrogen atoms have been seen in a difference map, they can generally be
  refined freely with isotropic adps, or with additional slack restraints.<br />
  If restraints are not used, the user can choose not to refine the hydrogens at all, to
  RIDE them on their parent atom, or to refine them either with fixed adps, or with
  refined isotropic adps.

  <div class="c1">
    <h2>Other Parameters</h2>
  </div>If the Flack parameter, extinction parameter or twin elements are present in the
  parameter list (LIST 5) you may need to refine them<br />

  <ul>
    <li>Flack Parameter<br />
    The Flack parameter should be refined for materials in non-centrosymmetric space
    groups. After a few cycles of refinement use the ANALYSE/ABSOLUTE CONFIG menu to
    check the absolute configuration. If the Flack parameter is close to zero and the su
    is small, set the parameter to zero and remove it from the refinement. Equally, if
    the value is close to unity, invert the structure ( STRUCTURE/INVERT menu) and then
    set the parameter to zero. if the value is somewhere in between (and with a small su)
    then you may have a <i>Twin by Inversion</i>, and you should continue to refine the
    parameter.<br />
    If the parameter has a large su then the data do not contain enough information to
    enable you to make a judgment based on the crystallography. See this <a href=
    "../analyse/absolute.html">HELP</a> file.</li>

    <li>Extinction<br />
    The Fo-Fc plot may have indicated the need for an extinction parameter. See this
    <a href="../analyse/analysis.html">HELP</a> file.</li>
  </ul>
