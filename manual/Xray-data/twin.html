  <h2>hklf4 reflection file transformation</h2>If, during the refinement of the structure,
  you come to suspect that the crysal was twinned, and you are unable to reprocess the
  data into an hklf5 file, CRYSTALS can attempt to allocate twin component identifiers to
  the hklf4 data.<br />
  The utility ROTAX will analyse Fo and Fc and suggest possible twin laws. You can either
  accept one of these findings, or enter a twin law of your own invention.
  <br /> CRYSTALS 
  converts the untwinned reflection file to the twinned equivalent<br />
  Use the menu <i>Analyse/ROTAX</i><br />

  <h2>hklf5 reflection file input</h2>
  <div class="c1"><h2>ROTAX is not the appropriate utility for inputting hklf5 
  data</h2></div>
  If you discovered that your crystal was twinned
  while it was on the diffractometer, you should have created a reflection file in
  <i>hklf5</i> format.<br />
  This format is incompatible with CRYSTALS, but the utility hklf52cry will convert the format.
  <strong>It will also attempt to analyse the reflections and derive the Twin laws</strong><br />
  Use the menu <i>Data/import hklf5 file</i> or<br />
  Use <i>Data/Open File</i> and select the hklf5 file. <strong>Dont forget to tick the
  box <i>SHELX hklf5 file</i> if this has not been automatically selected</strong>
  <br />
  See 
  <a href="hklf52cry.html"> here </a> for a description of how twins are handled in 
  CRYSTALS and <a href="table.html"> here </a> for a description of data input.
