History of CRYSTALS
*******************

   
Version 14 of CRYSTALS is based on a
version (Issue 2) written in FORTRAN by J.R. Carruthers in collaboration with
J.S.Rollett during 1977-78. This was a rewrite of the 1975 CRYSTALS 
system implemented in FORTRAN on the ICL 1900 series of computers. Many of the
crystallographic algorithms had previously been implemented in AUTOCODE on the
English Electric Leo Marconi KDF9 computer during the 1960's, and are described in some 
detail in Computing Methods in Crystallography, Pergamon Press, 1965, edited by 
John Rollett. Keith Prout raised much of the funding for the on-going work.

CRYSTALS continues to be developed, and now contains significant
contributions by  many of the students and visitors to the Chemical
Crystallography Laboratory, Oxford. 

* The SCRIPT processor was devised and implemented by Paul Betteridge in the
  1980's to provide an interactive user interface.


* The graphical user interface (GUI) was devised and written by Richard Cooper 
  in the 1990's as part of a Part II and D
  Phil project (supported by a CCDC studentship) in collaboration with
  Ludwig Macko and Markus Neuburger in Basel, who were working on a
  parallel Macintosh interface.


* The graphics module, CAMERON was devised and written by Lisa Pearce as part of a Part II 
  in 1990-91  and subsequent D Phil project (Supported by a Glaxo studentship). Its 
  functionality was based on a careful analysis of a number of pre-existing graphics 
  programs including SNOOPI, DTMM, CHEM-X, ORTEP, STRUPLOT, MOLDAW, COSMIC, MOLVIEW, PLUTO, 
  SHAKAL and MACMOLECULE.  It has been maintained and developed ever since.


* Extensive modernisation leading to substantial improvements in execution time 
  was undertaken by Pascal Parois during the 2010's, including the inclusion of
  some FORTRAN 95 constructs and the limited use of external libraries.



The whole system is maintained and directed by Richard Cooper.
