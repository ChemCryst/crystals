When CRYSTALS runs it stores all crystallographic data in a single file,
by default named crfilev2.dsc. This is a binary file and should not be
opened with any other program.


CRYSTALS outputs results and analysis to several places:


*The listing file:*


this will be called bfilenn.lis where nn is a number
from 00-99, incremented each time the program is run. When nn reaches 99
this file will be continuously overwritten every time CRYSTALS is run.


The listing file contains verbose output about all the calculations that
take place.


*The punch file:*


called bfile.pch by default. The idea of 'punching' data
is a throwback to the days of punched cards. This file is used to write out
specific bits of data *as* *commands* that can then be read back into the 
program. For example, the parameters defining the crystallographic model 
are stored in CRYSTALS as a 'List 5'. Then 'Punching List 5':
::


     \PUNCH 5
     END




will result in a full \\LIST 5 command being written to the file bfile.pch.
You can then recover that version of the model parameters by typing
::


     \USE bfile.pch




which causes the commands written in that file to be executed by CRYSTALS.


*The monitor file:*


called bfilenn.mon this is obsolete. If there is any
output in it, it is from a bit of the program that hasn't been looked at
recently.


*The log file:*


called bfilenn.log, this contains everything that you typed into CRYSTALS, 
and commands that were issued on your behalf by the menu system or script
processor.
