#YFile processing#
#PWhen CRYSTALS is running, instructions stored in a data file can be executed
 with:
#N   3#
#J
             !\USE  filename
#
#PTo find out what is in a file without obeying it, issue:
#N   3#
#J
            !\TYPE  filename
#
#PCRYSTALS automatically hooks in suitable files or devices to input and output
 channels. These can be changed while the program is running. For example, the
 listings can be directed to a new file, so that the previous file can be
 printed without stopping CRYSTALS. Output can also be directed to specially
 named files, or devices. The command used is:
#P
\RELEASE devicename filename
#PPermitted devices include:
#N   5#
#J
      MONITOR   The screen for online work, otherwise the .MON file (not PCs)
      PRINTER   The main listing file
      LOG   The copy (log) of all input
      PUNCH A card image file
#
#PThe filenames can be any system permitted file name.
 If omitted, a new file with the  default name is opened, possibly
 over-writing the previous file.
 Special devices are often available
#N  10#
#J
      :TT   The terminal screen (not PCs)
      :LP   The line printer itself
      :NL   The null device (dustbin)

 e.g.
    !\RELEASE PRINTER LP:
        sends output directly to the printer
    !\RELEASE LOG
        releases the log file, which could then
        be edited and used as input
    !\RELEASE PRINTER NL:
        sends the full listing to the dustbin.

#Q
#YDOS file name limitaions.#
#PUnder VMS file generation numbers prevent accidental over-writing of
 previous output. Under DOS and UNIX this facility is not available, nor
 is it always permitted to switch output to and from the screen or printer
 directly. The command
#N   3#
#J
      !\SET GENERATE ON
#
 causes the second part of the file names to be modified to help reduce this
 problem. This command could be put in the CRYSINIT file.
 Under DOS, all files for a given structure gave the specific part
 set to CRFILE, and the extension identifies the type of file.
#Q
#YAutomatic Disc extension.#
#PIf the .DSC file becomes full, CRYSTALS makes an attempt to extend it. The
 number of attempts and the increment are set by the program installer. The
 user can over -ride the defaults. See the section \DISK. The
 following commands permits very substantial disk  extensions.
#N   5#
#J
      !\DISK
      !EXTEND SIZE=10 TRIES=100
      !END
#
 These commands could be put in the CRYSINIT file.
#Q
#YCRYSINIT files.#
#PTheir function is similar to a LOGIN.COM or AUTOEXEC.BAT file, and they
 contain commands the user
 always wants executing when CRYSTALS starts. The special instruction
 \USE CONTROL by-passes SCRIPT mode startup.

#N  10#
#J
      !\ A CRYSINIT file to minimise output and pass directly
      !\ into command mode. Disc extensions are set large.
      !\DISK
      !EXTEND FREE=100 SIZE=10 TRIES=100
      !END
      !\SET TIMING OFF
      !\SET WATCH 5
      !\SET LISTS WRITE
      !\SET SRQ OFF
      !\SET SPEED FAST
      !\USE CONTROL
#
#PThe file CRYSTALS.SRT, usually in the directory CRIMAGES, is a master
CRYSINIT file obeyed every time CRYSTALS starts. You may edit this, but
take care.
