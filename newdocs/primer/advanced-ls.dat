ADVANCED REFINEMENTS
********************
CRYSTALS was originally conceived as a refinement program, and continuing
developments have maintained it as one of the best. The following examples
illustrate some common situations. Remember that  constraints are set in LIST
12, and restraints in LIST 16. They can be combined in almost any resonable
fashion. An important principle to remember in building constraints is
that it is _b{not parameters which are refined, but _i{sfifts in
parameters. Parameters cn be linked to have the same shift, even if the
staring values are (and will remain) different.
 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mixed isotropic and anisotropic refinement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 
::

      \LIST 12
      BLOCK      SCALE X'S
      CONTINUE   C(1,U'S) UNTIL O(42)
      CONTINUE   P(1,U[ISO]) UNTIL F(6)
      END
      \LIST 22
      END



These commands define a single matrix block containing the overall
scale factor, the positions for
all atoms, the anisotropic temperature factors for the first group of
atoms, and isotropic for the second. The command LIST 22 converts the
symbolic LIST 12 into an internal format, and  checks for
syntactic consistency. It should always be issued if LIST 12 is complex, so
that potential errors can be detected before least squares are started. It
also informs the user of the space
which will be needed for the matrix in the .DSC file. It is generated
internally if the user forgets.

 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Large structures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The user can refine different groups of parameters is  sucessive refinement
cycles, by issuing a new LIST 12 command between each cycle. It is also
possible to define a multi block refinement, a very effective method if the
blocks are carefully chosen. Each block should contain correlated parameters.
As a rough guide, the following groups of parameters are in general
highly correlated and should be refined in the same block if possible :
 
::

 1.  Temperature factors, scale factors, the extinction  parameter,
     the polarity parameter and the enantiopole parameter.
 2.  Coordinates of bonded atoms.
 3.  Non-orthogonal coordinates of the same atom.
 4.  U(11), U(22) and U(33) of the same atom.



If it is necessary to split the temperature factors and scale
factor into different blocks, their interactions must not be neglected
but be allowed for by using a 'dummy overall isotropic temperature
factor'.
In this case, the scale factor and the dummy temperature factor
must be put into a block of order 2 by themselves, and the program
will make the appropriate corrections to all the temperature factors.

 
::

      \LIST 12
      BLOCK X'S
      BLOCK U'S SCALE
      END



This defines a two block matrix. The scale factor should be with the
temperature factors.

 
::

      \LIST 12
      BLOCK C(1,X'S,U'S) UNTIL O(36)
      BLOCK C(37,X'S,U'S) UNTIL N(61)
      BLOCK SCALE DU[ISO]
      END



This defines a three block matrix for a structure containing two
uncorrelated (i.e. not related by pseudo -symmetry) fragments or molecules.
 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Tied parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Parameters can be tied individually, on a per atom basis, or for whole
groups of atoms.

 
::

      \LIST 12
      FULL X'S
      EQUIVALENCE C(10,OCC) CL(11,OCC) CL(12,OCC)
      RIDE        C(17,X'S) H(171,X'S) H(172,X'S) H(173,X'S)
      LINK        C(1,X'S,U[ISO])   UNTIL C(13)   AND
      CONTINUE    C(101,X'S,U[ISO]) UNTIL C(113)
      EQUIV       K(1,OCC) NA(1,OCC)
      WEIGHT   -1 NA(1,OCC)


The first command IMPLIES the positions of all atoms. Subsequent commands
EXPLICITLY refer to parameters, and over ride the implicit definitions. The
second command
ties the occupancies of the atoms in dichloromethane. The
third defines a methyl group with riding hydrogen positions. The fourth,
which continues onto the next line, ties all the parameters in one group with the
corresponding parameters in the second. The final equivalence ties the two
occupancies, but the weight card negates the shift applied to sodium. The
total of their occupancies is therefore constant.

 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Rigid groups refinement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Initial refinements of large or disordered structures are best done by
defining groups of atoms with well known geometries as rigid groups. The
geometry of the groups should first be idealised with \REGULAR. Each atom
may not occur in more than one group, though restraints can be applied to
any atoms, in or out of groups.
 
::

      \LIST 12
      FULL FE(1,X'S) P(1,X'S) CL(1,X'S) CL(2,X'S)
      CONTINUE U'S
      GROUP C(1) UNTIL C(5)
      RIDE  C(1,U'S) UNTIL C(5)
      GROUP C(6) UNTIL C(11)
      RIDE  C(6,U'S) UNTIL C(11)
      GROUP C(12) UNTIL C(17)
      RIDE  C(12,U'S) UNTIL C(17)
      GROUP C(18) UNTIL C(23)
      RIDE  C(18,U'S) UNTIL C(23)
      END



Four groups are refined together with 4 other atom positions and all
the anisotropic temperature factors. Each GROUP is given linked
anisotropic temperature shifts. They do not have to have the same
starting temperature factor values.

 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Pseudo-symmetry 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When a structure contains whole groups of highly correlated coordinates,
for example when a symmetry operator is lowered by generating atoms and
removing a symmetry operator, the refinement will be unstable. This can often
be controlled with:
 
::

      \LIST 16
      LIMIT .1 X
      LIMIT .1 Y
      LIMIT .1 Z
      END
      \LIST 12
      FULL
      COMBINE C(1,X'S) UNTIL C(23)  AND C(101,X'S) UNTIL C(123)
      END



The LIMIT restraints prevent wild divergence on the first round of least
squares, and the COMBINE  card combines the parameters from the original
fragment with those from the generated fragment - see the reference
Manual.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Absolute Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CRYSTALS permits the refinement of either the Rogers _I{eta or the
Flack _I{x parameter. The Flack parameter is more stable, and has a
physical interpretation throughout its permitted range (0 to 1). Its
refinement seems to be robust against DIFABS treatment, but does require
an extinction correction to be applied if necessary, and may also
require the inclusion of very weak refections. Note that these are often
systematically over-estimated. The listing file for a cycle of
refinement including the Flack parameter contains a list of 'enantiomer
sensitive' reflections. F+ is Fcalc for the current model, F- for the
inverse, and Fo is the observed value. Fo should tend to F+ or F-. If it
is consistently stronger or weaker, suspect the data collection.
If the material is expected to be chirally pure, once the hand has
been determined _I{x should be set to 0.0, and enantio removed from LIST
12 and turned off in LIST 23. If the material is twinned, enantio must
remain in the refinement.

     ~0.5         >0.5      Twinning undertermined


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Enantiomorphic Space Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For most space groups the hand of the structure can be inverted simply
by inverting the sign of all the atomic coordinates. For some, the space
group must also be changed, possible with a change in origin.
