 e.g.
      !\LIST 5
      !READ      NATOM = 3
      !ATOM      C 1 X=.23  .37   .45
      !ATOM      C 2 X=.31  Y=.06 .78
      !ATOM      O 6 OCC=.5 X=0.5  0   .25
      !END
#

Note that the parameters x, y, z are in sequence, so only the first keyword is
 requires, and that the parameters for atoms on special positions are not coded
 (as required by SHELX),
 and that there are defaults of 1.0 for occupancies, and 0.05 for Uiso.
