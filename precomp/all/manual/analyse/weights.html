    <h3 class="c2">ANALYSIS OF RESIDUALS w(Fo - Fc)**2 versus /Fc/</h3>
  </div><img src="agreement.png" /><br />
  <br />
  In the table, examine the weighted residual (headed w(delta)<sup>2</sup>, column 3 from
  the right). Towards the end of a refinement, this should be approximately constant as a
  function of Fo (or any other systematic ranking). If there is a systematic trend, then
  there is a systematic trend in the data which has not been modeled in the structure.
  You should verify that the structure is essentially correct, i.e. not in a false
  minimum. In particular, check columns 2 and 3, sum Fo and sum Fc. If, towards the
  bottom (i.e. strong reflections), &lt;Fo&gt;/&lt;Fc&gt; is substantially less than
  unity, you may need to include an isotropic EXTINCTION parameter in the least squares.
  Restore simple before starting the extinction parameter refinement.<br />
  If the parameters you are refining have 'reasonable' values, you should attempt to
  correct the data for the &lt;Fo&gt;/&lt;Fc&gt; trend, or introduce suitable additional
  parameters to the model.<br />
  If you can do neither of these, then you should modify the refinement weights to
  minimise the problem.<br />
  In the absence of specific technical advice, try automatic weighting. CRYSTALS uses
  different methods for F and F<sup>2</sup> refinement. Choose the scheme which gives a
  sufficiently constant distribution with the minimum number of parameters.<br />
  Occasional ranges having a large residual can be ignored in routine work.<br />

  <div class="c1">
    <h3 class="c2">CHOOSING WEIGHTS</h3>
  </div>It is dangerous to use a weighting scheme which has a dependancy on the mode
  (e.g. Chebychev or SHELX) in the early stages since a poor model may adversely
  down-weight important reflections. Unit Weights are usually excellent for refinement
  against F Simple Staistical weights (in which the observed sigma(I) values are
  augmented by a small contribution from the structure amplitude) are good for refinement
  against F^2. Once the model is complete and the refinement is partially converged
  CRYSTALS will try to select and optimise a weighting scheme for you.

  <div class="c1">
    <h3 class="c2">QUASI-UNIT WEIGHTS</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="c1">
    (w = 1.0 for F refinement, 1/(2F) for Fsq refinement)
  </div><br />
  This scheme is the most suitable for initial refinements, ie until the model is fully
  parameterised. It is rarely advisable for the final refinement since it leads to poor
  error estimates and will generate a checkcif error.

  <div class="c1">
    <h3 class="c2">SIMPLE STATISTICAL WEIGHTS</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="c1">
    (w=1/(SigmaSq + fixed modifier))
  </div><br />
  This scheme is most suitable for development stage refinement of good quality data free
  from serious systematic error, and where the model is complete and well behaved.

  <div class="c1">
    <h3 class="c2">ROBUST STATISTICAL</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="c1">
    (w=1/(SigmaSq))
  </div><br />
  This scheme is suitable for the case where the bulk of the data has small systematic
  errors, but may contain a few refelctions with serious casual errors, such as might
  occur from a high pressure cell. Seriuous outliers are given a weight of zero.

  <div class="c1">
    <h3 class="c2">MODIFIED SHELX</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="c1">
    w= 1.0 / ( sigma^2 + (aP)^2 + bP ), P = (Fo + 2Fc)/3
  </div><br />

  <div class="c1">
    or P=(Fo^2 + 2Fc^2)/3 depending on refinement against F or F^2.
  </div><br />
  This is a very popular weighting scheme. The parameters a and b are determined
  automatically in order to give a goodness of fit of approximately one and a flat
  analysis of variance across all ranges of Fc.

  <div class="c1">
    <h3 class="c2">OPTIMAL CHEBYCHEV WEIGHTS</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="c1">
    (w=function of residual)
  </div><br />
  This scheme is more flexible than the Modified SHELX scheme. It tries to compensate for
  errors in both the data and the model, and give optimal values for those parameters
  which are being refined. CRYSTALS tries to choose the optimal terms depending upon
  whether the refinement is against F or Fsq

  <div class="c1">
    <h3 class="c2">CHEBYCHEV(F)</h3>
  </div>Explicitly instruct CRYSTALS to optimise terms for refinement against F. May
  sometimes be useful for refinement against Fsq if the errors have an unusual
  distribution

  <div class="c1">
    <h3 class="c2">CHEBYCHEV(Fsq)</h3>
  </div>Explicitly instruct CRYSTALS to optimise terms for refinement against Fsq. May
  sometimes be useful for refinement against F if the errors have an unusual distribution
