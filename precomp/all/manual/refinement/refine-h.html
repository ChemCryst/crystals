    <h1>Refinement of Hydrogen Atoms</h1>
  </div>Having only one electron (which is often preoccupied with bonding to the adjacent
  atom) hydrogen atoms are not always well resolved with X-ray data.<br />
  This is less of a problem than formerly for data collected with modern low temperature
  instruments. It may still be a problem in disordered structures, for data from poor
  crystals or in very large structures.<br />
  The flexibility of CRYSTALS enables you to develop your own strategy for handling
  hydrogen atoms. Possible scenarios are:

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a name="compute" id="compute"></a> Compute the hydrogen atom positions using
      geometrical considerations. This can be done after every cycle of refinement of the
      remainder of the structure, or from time to time, or after the penultimate
      cycle.<br />
      In this case, your LIST 12 should contain no reference to hydrogen. Remember that
      the short hand methods for refering to parameters does not apply to hydrogen.<br />
      <pre>
#LIST 12
FULL X'S U'S
END
</pre>After you have recomputed the ideal hydrogen positions, you will need to do one (or
more) final cycles of refinement in order to create the parameter correlation matrix
needed for the computation of parameter esds (sus).
    </li>

    <li>
      <a name="refine" id="refine"></a> Freely refine the hydrogen atoms. Unless you have
      startlingly good data, the hydrogen atoms are usually refined with an isotropic
      model.<br />
      <pre>
#LIST 12
FULL X'S U'S
CONTINUE H(1,X'S,U[ISO] UNTIL H(23)
END
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>
      <a name="constrain" id="constrain"></a> Refine the hydrogen atoms with
      <strong>RIDING constraints</strong> . This strategy moves the hydrogen atoms
      synchronously with their parent atoms. It conserves the bond length and direction,
      but does not conserve the angles to adjacent atoms. It is quite a good technique to
      use for the finialisation of a refinement.
      <pre>
#LIST     12                                                                    
BLOCK SCALE X'S  U'S 
RIDE C   (   1,X'S) H   (  12,X'S) H   (  11,X'S) H   (  13,X'S) 
RIDE N   (   3,X'S) H   (  31,X'S) 
RIDE C   (   6,X'S) H   (  61,X'S) D   (  62,X'S) 
RIDE C   (   7,X'S) H   (  72,X'S) H   (  71,X'S) 
RIDE C   (  11,X'S) H   ( 113,X'S) H   ( 112,X'S) H   ( 111,X'S) 
END                                                                             
</pre>This looks a bit tedious to set up for a large structure, but CRYSTALS has a script
(under the <i>Refinement</i> tab) to do most of the job for you. The constraints are
created in a file <i>RIDEDAT.12</i>, which you could edit if you need to make changes.
    </li>

    <li>
      <a name="restrain" id="restrain"></a> Refine the hydrogen atoms with soft
      <strong>restraints</strong>. This is my prefered strategy since the restraints
      provide guidance for the positioning of the atoms, but the X-ray data is also
      providing information from the molecule itself. Restraints are held in LIST 16.
      <pre>
#LIST 16
REM            H1-N-R2
DIST 0.86, 0.02 = 
CONT N ( 3) to H(31) 
REST 0.038, 0.002 = H(31,u[iso]) 
ANGLE 0.0, 2.0 = MEAN 
CONT H(31) TO N ( 3) TO C(2) 
CONT H(31) TO N ( 3) TO C(5) 
END
</pre>This also look a bit tedious to sset up but there is a script (under the
<i>Refinement</i> tab) to do most of the job for you. The restraints are created in a
file <i>H-RESTRAINTS.PCH</i>, which you could edit if you need to make changes.
    </li>
  </ul><br />

  <div class="c1">
    <h2>Default Hydrogen Atom Restraints</h2>
  </div>The target bond lengths to hydrogen depend upon the environment. The table shows
  the default values. The target angles depend upon the hybridisation of the pivot atom.
  If you refine the isotropic adp (temperature factor), it will be restrained to the
  value of the component of the pivot atom adp in the direction of the H-bond, increased
  by the multiplier show in the table.<br />

  <div class="c1">
    <h2>Changing Hydrogen Atom Constraints and Restraints</h2>
  </div>There are items in the <i>Information Tabs</i> (at the bottom of the window)
  which open either the constraint list (LIST 12) or the restraint list (LIST 16) in an
  editor. Using this option enable you to change the default values created by CRYSTALS,
  and to add or remove constraints and restraints. <strong><span class="c2">Beware that
  any edits you have made will be lost if you ask CRYSTALS to create new restraint or
  constraint lists</span></strong><br />
