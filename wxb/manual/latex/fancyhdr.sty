% MODIFICATION HISTORY:
% Sep 16, 1994
% version 1.4: Correction for use with \reversemargin
% Sep 29, 1994:
% version 1.5: Added the \iftopfloat, \ifbotfloat and \iffloatpage commands
% Oct 4, 1994:
% version 1.6: Reset single spacing in headers/footers for use with
% setspace.sty or doublespace.sty
% Oct 4, 1994:
% version 1.7: changed \let\@mkboth\markboth to
% \def\@mkboth{\protect\markboth} to make it more robust
% Dec 5, 1994:
% version 1.8: corrections for amsbook/amsart: define \@chapapp and (more
% importantly) use the \chapter/sectionmark definitions from ps@headings if
% they exist (which should be true for all standard classes).
% May 31, 1995:
% version 1.9: The proposed \renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{\iffloatpage...
% construction in the doc did not work properly with the fancyplain style.
% June 1, 1995:
% version 1.91: The definition of \@mkboth wasn't restored on subsequent
% \pagestyle{fancy}'s.
% June 1, 1995:
% version 1.92: The sequence \pagestyle{fancyplain} \pagestyle{plain}
% \pagestyle{fancy} would erroneously select the plain version.
% June 1, 1995:
% version 1.93: \fancypagestyle command added.
% Dec 11, 1995:
% version 1.94: suggested by Conrad Hughes <chughes@maths.tcd.ie>
% CJCH, Dec 11, 1995: added \footruleskip to allow control over footrule
% position (old hardcoded value of .3\normalbaselineskip is far too high
% when used with very small footer fonts).
% Jan 31, 1996:
% version 1.95: call \@normalsize in the reset code if that is defined,
% otherwise \normalsize.
% this is to solve a problem with ucthesis.cls, as this doesn't
% define \@currsize. Unfortunately for latex209 calling \normalsize doesn't
% work as this is optimized to do very little, so there \@normalsize should
% be called. Hopefully this code works for all versions of LaTeX known to
% mankind.
% April 25, 1996:
% version 1.96: initialize \headwidth to a magic (negative) value to catch
% most common cases that people change it before calling \pagestyle{fancy}.
% Note it can't be initialized when reading in this file, because
% \textwidth could be changed afterwards. This is quite probable.
% We also switch to \MakeUppercase rather than \uppercase and introduce a
% \nouppercase command for use in headers. and footers.
% May 3, 1996:
% version 1.97: Two changes:
% 1. Undo the change in version 1.8 (using the pagestyle{headings} defaults
% for the chapter and section marks. The current version of amsbook and
% amsart classes don't seem to need them anymore. Moreover the standard
% latex classes don't use \markboth if twoside isn't selected, and this is
% confusing as \leftmark doesn't work as expected.
% 2. include a call to \ps@empty in ps@@fancy. This is to solve a problem
% in the amsbook and amsart classes, that make global changes to \topskip,
% which are reset in \ps@empty. Hopefully this doesn't break other things.
% May 7, 1996:
% version 1.98:
% Added % after the line  \def\nouppercase
% May 7, 1996:
% version 1.99: This is the alpha version of fancyhdr 2.0
% Introduced the new commands \fancyhead, \fancyfoot, and \fancyhf.
% Changed \headrulewidth, \footrulewidth, \footruleskip to
% macros rather than length parameters, In this way they can be
% conditionalized and they don't consume length registers. There is no need
% to have them as length registers unless you want to do calculations with
% them, which is unlikely. Note that this may make some uses of them
% incompatible (i.e. if you have a file that uses \setlength or \xxxx=)
% May 10, 1996:
% version 1.99a:
% Added a few more % signs
% May 10, 1996:
% version 1.99b:
% Changed the syntax of \f@nfor to be resistent to catcode changes of :=
% Removed the [1] from the defs of \lhead etc. because the parameter is
% consumed by the \@[xy]lhead etc. macros.
% June 24, 1997:
% version 1.99c:
% corrected \nouppercase to also include the protected form of \MakeUppercase
% \global added to manipulation of \headwidth.
% \iffootnote command added.
% Some comments added about \@fancyhead and \@fancyfoot.
% Aug 24, 1998
% version 1.99d
% Changed the default \ps@empty to \ps@@empty in order to allow
% \fancypagestyle{empty} redefinition.
