<A NAME="Cameron - Include and Exclude"> </A>
<P>The commands INCLUDE and EXCLUDE are very useful as they
control which
atoms are drawn at any one time. The syntax for both of the
commands is
very similar as they are effectively the reverse of each other.
</div>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>INCLUDE</u></strong><br>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>EXCLUDE</u></strong><br>
<P>These commands may be entered on their own and be follow by
atom or
element names. The syntax is :-
<pre>
nnCLUDE at1 at2 el1 el2
</pre><p><BR>
Once an atom has been EXCLUDED from the picture it is not drawn
and it
is not included in any calculations eg PACK or ENCLOSURE.
<A NAME="Cameron - Include and Exclude All"> </A>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>ALL</i></strong>
The ALL sub-command is a 'blanket' command that applies the
IN/EXCLUDE
operation to ALL of the atoms in the current view. Therefore if
we want
to exclude more atoms than we want to include we can use EXCLUDE
ALL to
get rid of all of the atoms and then add in those we want by
using
INCLUDE.
<A NAME="Cameron - Include and Exclude Group"> </A>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>GROUP</i></strong>
The command DEFGROUP is available to define groups of atoms that
are to
be referred to as a whole. The IN/EXCLUDE command can be used
with GROUP
to remove or atoms all of the atoms in the group in the picture
as
required.
<A NAME="Cameron - Include and Exclude Fragment"> </A>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>FRAGMENT</i></strong>
The user can specify atoms to be IN/EXCLUDEd by defining groups of atoms
as fragments. A fragment is defined by a single atom, and consists of
all the atoms linked to it by the current CONNECTIVITY TABLE. That is,
if atoms are excluded from the picture the bonds ARE NOT broken and
FRAGMENT will use bonds involving excluded atoms in its calculations.
 The user
can select this atom by typing or by clicking on it with the mouse.
ie. EXCLUDE FRAGMENT C1 will exclude C1, any atoms joined to C1, any
atoms joined to those atoms etc.
<A NAME="Cameron - Include and Exclude Cell"> </A>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>CELL</i></strong>
It is often useful to see how the atoms being drawn relate to the
unit
cell. IN/EXCLUDE CELL is used to control the inclusion of the
unit cell
(in the LINE style) on the picture.
<A NAME="Cameron - Include and Exclude Area"> </A>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>AREA</i></strong>
Choosing INCLUDE or EXCLUDE AREA in the PC version allows the user to 
draw a polygonal area with the mouse. The polygon is created by clicking
with the left button on the position required for the vertices. The 
polygon is closed by clicking close to the initial position. The mouse 
cursor is changed to a cross during polygon creation and to an arrow when 
you are close enough to the initial point for closure to occur. Hitting 
the &lt;return&gt; key or clicking with the right mouse button will abort the 
operation.
<A NAME="Cameron - Include and Exclude Select"> </A>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>SELECT</i></strong>
The select option is equivalent to EXCLUDE ALL followed by INCLUDE AREA.
The polygonal area is chosen in the same way as described above and all 
atoms not within that area are excluded.

<P>For pictures with more than one 'type' of constituent atom three more
commands will prove to be useful.
<A NAME="Cameron - Mask and Unmask"> </A>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>MASK</u></strong><br>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>UNMASK</u></strong><br>
<P>The MASK command has the same syntax as EXCLUDE ie.
<pre>
(UN)MASK at1 at2 el1 el2 ...
</pre><p><BR>
It is used to remove atoms from current INCLUDE operations - ie atoms
that have been MASKed will not be included when using INCLUDE ALL. For
example the user could MASK out solvent molecules from a diagram leaving
the 'basic' asymmetric unit to be worked on. UNMASK can be used to
re-include the required atoms. The sub commands ALL and GROUP are
available for use with both MASK and UNMASK.
<A NAME="Cameron - Include and Exclude Switch"> </A>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>SWITCH</u></strong><br>
<P>The SWITCH command causes any atoms that are EXCLUDEd from the picture
to be INCLUDEd and vice versa. This command can be used in conjunction
with MASK as any MASKed atoms WILL NOT be included in the picture after
a SWITCH operation.
<P>Consider an asymmetric unit containing an anion, a cation and some
solvent. The user could MASK out the solvent atoms. EXCLUDE the anion
and obtain pictures of the cation atoms. The SWITCH command then
allows the user to examine the anion without having to INCLUDE and
EXCLUDE atoms, and the solvent atoms remain excluded throughout.

<A NAME="Cameron - Include and Exclude Dummy"> </A>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>DUMMY</u></strong><br>
<P>In certain circumstances it may be useful for the user to be
able to
generate new 'dummy' atoms from the initial atomic coordinates.
One
example of this is a compound that contains a cyclopentadienyl ring. The
bonding in
such a system can either be represented as five M - C bonds or
as a
single bond to the ring's centre. The syntax for the command is:
<pre>
INCLUDE DUMMY d
</pre><p><BR>
where d is the name of the created atom. This must then be
followed by a
sub-command which defines the atoms position.
<div class="directive"><strong><i>COORDS</i></strong>
This specifies the atoms coordinates in unit cell fractions. The
syntax
is:
<pre>
COORDS x y z
</pre><p><BR>
<A NAME="Cameron - Include and Exclude Centroid"> </A>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>CENTROID</i></strong>
Alternatively, the atoms position can be defined relative to
others
already in the molecule. At least TWO atoms must be entered to
define
new atoms position and it is placed at the CENTROID of their
coordinates. The syntax is:
<pre>
CENTROID at1 at2 at3 ...
</pre><p><BR>
<div class="parameter"><i>ALL</i>
A further sub-command is available so that the new atom is placed
at the
centroid of all of the atoms in the molecule. This will prove
particulary useful when trying to alter the spacegroup of a
structure eg
to convert from P 1 to P -1 as the centre of inversion will lie
at the
newly generated dummy atom whose coordinates are output once they
have
been calculated.
