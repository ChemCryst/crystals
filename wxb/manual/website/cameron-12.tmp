<P>It is important that the user has complete control over the
bonds displayed in a drawing. The CONNECT group of options is a
complicated one but has been designed so as to provide to user
with a
fully flexible set of commands.

<P>CONNECT is used in one of two ways, either on its own or with
a
modifying sub-command.
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>CONNECT</u></strong><br>
The syntax for this command is:
<pre>
CONNECT X Y dmin dmax
</pre><p><BR>
<P>This will create two lists of atoms (one from X and one from Y
which may
be atoms, elements or * as required) and uses these lists
when calculating connectivity. dmin and dmax are in angstroms. The
distances between all combinations of the atoms in the two lists
are
determined. If distances any lie within
the specified dmin -&gt; dmax range (and the bonds do not already
exist)
they will be added into the connectivity lists.  To connect up
CU1 O bonds for example you could
use:
<pre>
CONNECT CU1 O 0.0 2.0
</pre><p><BR>
which would create one list - containing Cu1 only - and another
list -
containing all of the oxygen atoms - and then search for
inter-list
bonds. In this way, if any O - O bonds exist within the given
range they
will NOT be found. Note that if you require
connections to be calculated between atoms of the same type you
use:
<pre>CONNECT X X dmin dmax.
<div class="directive"></pre><p><strong><i>ALL</i></strong>
CONNECT ALL requires two arguments dmin and dmax. The result is
identical to CONNECT above except that ALL of the atoms are
included in
the calculation.
<pre>
CONNECT ALL 0.0 2.0
</pre><p><BR>
will draw all bonds that fall within the 0.0 - 2.0 angstrom range.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>DEFAULT</i></strong>
CONNECT DEFAULT requires no arguments. This command does two
things:
<pre>
1)      Reset all of the connectivity radii
        to their initial values
2)      Calculate the connectivity according
        to these radii.
</pre><p><BR>
It is effectively a 'start again' option as it removes any
changes in
bonding that have been introduced with the JOIN, REMOVE etc
options.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>RADII</i></strong>
This is a sub-command of CONNECT and comes immediately after it.
It requires the following arguments:
<pre>
CONNECT RADII X r
</pre><p><BR>
where X is the name of an atom or element and r is its new
connectivity
radius. The connectivity of this atom/element is then
redetermined.
<div class="parameter"><i>COVALENT</i>
</div>
<div class="parameter"><i>IONIC</i>
</div>
<div class="parameter"><i>VANDERWAALS</i>
These subcommands set the specified atoms to appropriate connectivity 
radii eg CONNECT RADII IONIC N. The further subcommand ALL can be used 
to set all atoms.
</div>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>HBONDS</i></strong>
This command enables the user to search for hydrogen bonds within
the
structure. The syntax is :-
<pre>
CONNECT HBONDS dmin dmax X Y
</pre><p><BR>
dmin/dmax is the range for searching (in angstroms), X/Y are atoms/elements to
be
included in the search. For a H-bond to be valid it must be
bonded to
one of the atoms in the list X,Y etc AND be within the range of
another
of the atoms. For example, if we are searching for H-bonds
involving oxygen atoms:
<pre>
CONNECT HBONDS 0.0 2.5 O
</pre><p><BR>
will achieve this. There may well be eg C - H - O linkages within
the range
but only O - H - O ones will be registered. In this way we can
filter
the search and set a large value for dmax so that all the H-bonds
are
discovered without obtaining spurious information. The bond style
used
for H-bonds is dotted.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>INTER</i></strong>
<P>This option is intended to be used after a PACK or ENCLOSURE 
operation. This will find connections between atoms which have DIFFERENT
packnumbers - ie. between assymetric units or between different GROUPS 
if PACK or ENCLOSURE GROUP has been used. The bonds are in the DOTTED 
style when generated. The syntax is:
<pre>
CONNECT INTER O C 0.0 3.0
</pre><p><BR>
as for CONNECT itself.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>FULL</i></strong>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>DOTTED</i></strong>
<P>The CONNECT command can also be used if bonds already exist to
alter the
style. There are three options:
<pre>
CONNECT DOTTED at1 at2
CONNECT DOTTED at1 el1
CONNECT DOTTED el1 el2
</pre><p><BR>
These change the style of the single bond at1-at2, the
style
of any el1-at1 bonds and the style of any el1-el2 bonds respectively. Note
that in
the latter case, el1 and el2 may be the same element ie you can
make all
C-C bonds dotted.
<BR>
</div>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>JOIN</u></strong><br>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>DOTTED</i></strong>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>FULL</i></strong>
<P>Another connectivity header command is JOIN. This is a more
specific
command which is used to make a new bond. The syntax is:
<pre>
JOIN DOTTED at1 at2
JOIN FULL al1 at2
</pre><p><BR>
This will create a new bond between at1 and at2 of the specified type.
</div>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>REMOVE</u></strong><br>
This is the reverse command to JOIN. It will break the bond between 
the specified atoms. The syntax is:
<pre>
REMOVE at1 at2
</pre><p><BR>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>DISCONNECT</u></strong><br>
<P>This command is the reverse of CONNECT.
<pre>
DISCONNECT C O 0.5 1.5
</pre><p><BR>
will get rid of any C-O bonds that are OUTSIDE the range 0.5 - 1.5
angstroms.
<div class="directive"><strong><i>ALL</i></strong>
DISCONNECT ALL removes all of the connectivity information.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>GROUP</i></strong>
DISCONNECT GROUP is intended primarily for use with disordered
structures although other uses can be envisaged. For example a
substituent
may be 'flipping' between two sites generating very short
distances between
atoms in different groups. It is not possible to DISCONNECT these
bonds
since some of the distances may appear to be 'normal'. To get
over this,
each disordered part is defined as a group (See DEFGROUP) and
DISCONNECT
GROUP is used to remove any bonds that exist between them. The
syntax is:
<pre>
DISCONNECT GROUP group1 group2
</pre><p><BR>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>ATOM</i></strong>
<P>This command deletes ALL bonds involving the specified atom. The 
syntax is:
<pre>
DISCONNECT ATOM at1 
</pre><p><BR>
</div>
</div>

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="12.2">12.2: Miscellaneous CONNECT commands</A></H3></CENTER>
<P>There are three other commands which either relate to
connectivity or
to how the bond is represented on the output device.
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>TAPER</u></strong><br>
This controls the bond tapering. It has an initial value of 2.0. Increasing this increases the tapering of the bonds. This
tapering is
useful as it introduces a 3-D effect into the drawing. If
tapering is
not required then entering:
<pre>
CONNECT TAPER 0.0
</pre><p><BR>
will achieve this.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>THICKNESS</u></strong><br>
<P>This command controls the thickness (radius) of the bonds in
angstroms. It
requires one argument, whose default value is 0.02.
<pre>
CONNECT THICKNESS 0.04
</pre><p><BR>
will double the radius of the bonds as drawn.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>TOLERANCE</u></strong><br>
<P>This sets the tolerance used when determining whether or not
a bond
exists. The formula used is:
<pre>
If  dist &lt; ( C1 + C2 ) * tol  then a bond exists
</pre><p><BR>
where C1 and C2 are the connectivity radii of the atoms in
question.
The initial value of 'tol' is 1.1 ie the interatomic distance has
to be no
more than 10% greater than the sum of the two connectivity radii
for a
bond to be found. The syntax for the command is:
<pre>
CONNECT TOLERANCE n
</pre><p><BR>
</div>
