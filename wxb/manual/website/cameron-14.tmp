<A NAME="Cameron - Labelling atoms"> </A>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>LABEL</u></strong><br>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>NOLABEL</u></strong><br>
<P>The LABEL and NOLABEL commands control the atom labelling. They
are
set up in an identical way to INCLUDE and EXCLUDE and the syntax
is
identical:
<pre>
LABEL C1 C2 O
NOLABEL C H1
LABEL ALL
NOLABEL ALL
LABEL GROUP g1 ....
</pre><p><BR>
are all valid. Note that atoms will not be labelled if they are
not included in the picture.
<div class="directive"><strong><i>MOUSE</i></strong>
<P>All atoms will be labelled if the LABEL command has been used for
them. The label positions can be altered using the mouse if required.
Note that label positions are recalculated if atoms are included or
excluded or a change in the view direction has occurred. Therefore, it is
advisable that the 'final' view is obtained before labels are positioned
with the mouse.
<P>Mouse labelling is controlled as follows. The user clicks on a
position on the screen (once the message Mouse Labelling activated has
been seen). If this position is over a label then the label is replaced
by a box of the same size as the label. A red cross is drawn over the
atom that the label refers to to aid identification. The mouse is then
used to position the TOP LEFT HAND CORNER of the label by a second
click. Alternatively, hitting the N key (for Nolabel) will remove the
label altogether.
<P>If the mouse is clicked on an atom which is NOT labelled then a label
will appear at the atom centre, this label can then be moved as
described above.
<P>If at any time the user wishes to view the current picture without 
releasing the mouse, this can be done by hitting the 'V' key.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>GENERATED</i></strong>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>INITIAL</i></strong>
<P>These commands relate to the pack number display while labelling.
Atoms are assigned a pack number after PACK or ENCLOSURE. This number is
then displayed as eg N1_5. These numbers are used to refer to atoms and
elements as required. INITIAL (the default) will just display N1 while
GENERATED shows N1_5.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>CELL</i></strong>
Controls the cell labelling.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>FRAGMENT</i></strong>
Allows the user to set labels for a given fragment.
</div>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>FONT</u></strong><br>
This sets the point size of the font to be used in hardcopy output. It 
requires one argument.
<div class="directive"><strong><i>DEFAULT</i></strong>
This resets the point size to its default value.
</div>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>TEXT</u></strong><br>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>POSITION</i></strong>
This allows the user to annotate a picture. The syntax is:
<pre>
TEXT "text string" POSITION x y
</pre><p><BR>
The text must be in quotes. x and y are the 
position of the text in percentages from the top left hand corner of the
diagram. 
After the text is processed it is assigned a number.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>NUMBER</i></strong>
The NUMBER command can be used to move a text item after it has been 
created by using TEXT NUMBER n POSITION x y.
