<A NAME="Cameron - Misc picture control"> </A>
<P>There are a few other commands in CAMERON which deal with control of
the type of picture being used.
</div>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>MAXIMISE</u></strong><br>
<P>This command is related to the VIEW commands PLANE, ALONG, VERTICAL
etc. In these commands the view direction does not define all of the
degrees of freedom of the molecule. It is possible to rotate the
molecule further so that as much of is as possible is shown on the
screen.
<div class="directive"><strong><i>ON</i></strong>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>OFF</i></strong>
<P>These two commands switch maximisation calculations ON and OFF. These
calculations are slow - especially for large molecules so they are
included as an option.
</div>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>SCALE</u></strong><br>
<div class="directive"><BR>DFIX
</div>
<div class="directive"><BR>DUNFIX
<P>These two commands allow the user to control the calculation of
picture scale. SCALE FIX sets the scale to its current value and does
not recalculate it, irrespective of changes in the number and position
of atoms in the picture. SCALE UNFIX reverts to scale calculations.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>SET</i></strong>
<P>SCALE SET is followed by a number, the value of the scale to be used
for all subsequent pictures. This can be altered with another SCALE SET
command or by issuing SCALE UNFIX.
<BR>
