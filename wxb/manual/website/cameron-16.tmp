<CENTER><H3><A NAME="16.1">16.1: Input of symmetry operators</A></H3></CENTER>
<P>CAMERON is a crystallographically oriented program and hence
many of
its functions require the use of symmetry operators. There are
two
methods of inputting the symmetry operators, inputting the
Spacegroup
symbol and inputting the individual operators themselves.
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>SPACEGROUP</u></strong><br>
<P>The SPACEGROUP command is followed by the symbol, which must
contain
all UPPER CASE letters. If the symbol is in a non-standard
setting then
the full symbol must be entered. For example  P 21 will be
interpreted
as P 1 21 1 which is the standard setting. If P 21 1 1 is
required then
the "1's" must be entered to force the choice of unique axis.
<P>The syntax of the command is:
<pre>
SPACEGROUP X X X X
</pre><p><BR>
where X are "fields" of the symbol, with spaces between fields
ie
entered as P 21 and NOT P21. The program will then output the
operators
that have been calculated for the symbol . Note that if a centre
of
inversion is present the inverted operators will NOT be shown.
Also the
operators generated from the centring vectors - eg 1/2 1/2 1/2
for body
centring - will NOT be shown. The complete list of operators used
for
packing etc can be found by entering INFO SYMMETRY.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>SYMMETRY</u></strong><br>
<P>The input of symmetry operators can be done "by hand" if
required.
There are several steps and sub-commands available to do this.
<div class="directive"><strong><i>OPERATORS</i></strong>
<P>This sub-command MUST be entered even if only the x y z
operator is to
be included. The syntax is :-
<pre>
SYMMETRY OPERATORS x y z -x y+1/2 -z ...
</pre><p><BR>
with the operators being entered with the translational part in
fractional form ( 1/2 , 1/3 , 1/4 , 2/3 , 1/6 , 5/6 are
recognised )
which must come after the x/y/z as required. The
fractional
part must be linked to the x/y/z part with a + or - sign. Note
that NO
spaces are allowed within each part of the operator. This is so
that
ambiguities cannot arise.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>CENTRE</i></strong>
<P>This command is used to introduce a centre of inversion into
the
symmetry information it must be followed by a centring letter 
(P,A,B,C,I,F,R) or the command VECTORS.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>NOCENTRE</i></strong>
<P>This command is used to specify that there is no centre of
inversion - the centring vectors are the specified by letter or by using
VECTORS.
<div class="parameter"><i>VECTORS</i>
<P>This command enables the user to introduce centring vectors
into the
symmetry operators eg for body centring use :-
<pre>
VECTORS 0 0 0 1/2 1/2 1/2
</pre><p><BR>
</div>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>USE</i></strong>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>NOUSE</i></strong>
These commands allow the user to omit certain symmetry operators from
the packing calculations. The command is followed by the operator
numbers
(found using INFO SYMMETRY) of the operators needed.
<div class="parameter"><i>ALL</i>
This may be used to USE/NOUSE all of the operators. Note that using
NOUSE ALL without following it with USE n will result in no atoms being
generated after a pack operation!

<P>In order to end up with the Spacegroup F m m m we require :-

<pre>
SPACEGROUP F M M M

or

<div class="instruction"><strong><u>SETUNIT</u></strong><br>
<P>This command causes the atoms that are to be included in the
current
picture to be set as the asymmetric unit. Their data then
replaces that
of the initially input atoms and they are used as the asymmetric
unit
from now on. This is useful if, for example only half of a
molecule is
present in the asymmetric unit. The other half can be generated
with ADD
and then SETUNIT is used to treat all of the atoms as the basic
"building block". SETUNIT is a DANGEROUS command in that it
cannot be
undone - UNPACK will NOT reverse the operation. Therefore the
user is
prompted for confirmation before the command is executed. The
syntax is
simply SETUNIT.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>ENANTIO</u></strong><br>
This command inverts the hand of the atoms in the asymmetric unit. Note
that the operator applied is :-

<pre>
-1  0  0
 0 -1  0
 0  0 -1
</pre><p><BR>
and no spacegroup changes that may be required are made.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>SPECIAL</u></strong><br>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>ON</i></strong>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>OFF</i></strong>
Controls the special position calculations that occur during packing to 
eliminate duplicate atoms. By default this is ON.
