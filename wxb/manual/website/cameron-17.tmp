<A NAME="Cameron - Packing commands"> </A>
<P>There are two methods of crystal packing available, PACK and
ENCLOSURE. Both use ALL of the symmetry operators in the
Spacegroup to
generate all of the atoms that lie within a user-defined volume.
The
commands ADD and MOVE are available if single symmetry operators
are
required. The difference between the two commands lies in the
method of
volume definition.

<P>The PACK command allows the user to define a volume to be
filled
relative to the unit cell. One of two-sub commands is required
to define
this volume.
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>CELL</u></strong><br>
PACK CELL will cause the program to generate all the atoms that
lie
within the unit cell. This is the default option if no range for
packing
is input.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>WINDOW</u></strong><br>
PACK WINDOW allows the user to define the volume in terms of the
unit
cell axes. It is followed by three pairs of numbers.
<pre>
PACK WINDOW xmin xmax ymin ymax zmin zmax
</pre><p><BR>
The values of xmin etc are relative to the unit cell origin.
Therefore
to define a volume of which contained all of the x axis, all of
the y axis and
the first half of the z axis we would use:
<pre>
PACK WINDOW 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.5
</pre><p><BR>
If more than one unit cell is required negative numbers and
numbers
exceeding one may be used.
<P>One more sub-command may be entered after the WINDOW or CELL
commands.
If this command is omitted then the option chosen in the last
PACK
command will be used. If this is the first time PACK is used then
CUT is
the default option.
Three sub-commands are available:
<div class="directive"><strong><i>CUT</i></strong>
CUT will generate all the atoms that lie within the defined
volume. ie.
the generation is "cut" at the boundary.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>COMPLETE</i></strong>
COMPLETE is most useful for molecular crystallographers. It will
generate all the asymmetric units that have ANY ATOMS lying with
the
defined volume.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>CENTROID</i></strong>
CENTROID is similar to COMPLETE except that it calculates the
centroid
of the asymmetric unit (as though all of the atoms have equal
weight) and
includes only those which have their centroid within the defined
volume.
This is particulary useful for molecular crystallographers as it
creates
a picture without the "odd atoms" at the edge of the unit cell.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="17.2">17.2: Dealing with connectivity</A></H3></CENTER>
<P>There are three other qualifying commands that apply to PACK:
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>INTRA</u></strong><br>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>INTER</u></strong><br>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>KEEP</u></strong><br>
These deal with the treatment of connectivity calculations once
the PACK
has been carried out.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>INTRA</u></strong><br>
<P>This qualifiers means that the connectivity will be calculated
within
each newly generated asymmetric unit only. Any changes to the
bonding -
eg with JOIN, REMOVE, CONNECT, COLOUR BONDS - will be undone.
This is
the fastest option.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>INTER</u></strong><br>
<P>In this case connectivity is calculated once all of the atoms
have
been generated - therefore if any intra-unit bonds exist they
will be
found.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>KEEP</u></strong><br>
<P>This is the default option. Connectivity is copied from the
unit used
to do the packing - this includes colour and style changes if any
- into
the bond info of the new atoms. This is done for each asymmetric
unit as
it is generated and is slower than INTRA as it requires more
comparisons
to be carried out.

<P>Therefore, to create a picture containing all of the complete
molecules within a cube of side equal to 2 unit cells we need :-

<pre>
PACK
WINDOW 0.0 2.0 0.0 2.0 0.0 2.0
COMPLETE
</pre><p><BR>
Or alternatively,
<pre>
PACK
WINDOW -1.0 1.0 -1.0 1.0 -1.0 1.0
COMPLETE
</pre><p><BR>

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="17.4">17.4: ENCLOSURE</A></H3></CENTER>
<P>The enclosure command is more flexible than PACK as it enables
the
user to choose the "origin" for the atom generation. The first
task is
to specify this origin which is either a point in the unit cell
or an
atom.

<div class="instruction"><strong><u>ATOM</u></strong><br>
<P>If we wish to generate the atoms around Cu1 in order to examine
the
coordination environment for example we can use:
<pre>
ENCLOSURE ATOM CU1
</pre><p><BR>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>POINT</u></strong><br>
<P>Alternatively we can choose the centre of the unit cell:
<pre>
ENCLOSURE POINT 0.5 0.5 0.5
</pre><p><BR>
The POINT sub-command can be used if an atom does not lie at the
point in
question eg if we are examining a "hole" within a structure.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="17.6">17.6: Type of volume to be used</A></H3></CENTER>
<P>There are three different ways of defining the volume of
enclosure:
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>SPHERE</u></strong><br>
This will generate a sphere of enclosure about the origin. The
syntax is:
<pre>
SPHERE r
</pre><p><BR>
where r is the radius in angstroms of the sphere.
<pre>
e.g. ENCLOSURE ATOM C1 SPHERE 4.0 CUT VIEW
</pre><p><BR>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>ANORTHIC</u></strong><br>
This is used to generate an ANORTHIC box ie a box whose sides are parallel to the unit cell axes. As this box is directly related
to the
unit cell its dimensions are given in fractional coordinates. The
syntax
is:
<pre>
ANORTHIC -x +x -y +y -z +z
</pre><p><BR>
Therefore, to generate an anorthic box with sides extending one
quarter of a unit
cell in all six directions from the defined origin we use:
<pre>
ANORTHIC 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25
</pre><p><BR>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>ORTHOGONAL</u></strong><br>
This is used to generate a box whose sides are perpendicular to
each
other. The z axis lies along the current view direction and the
x and y
axes lie across and vertically up the screen respectively. The
dimensions of this box is defined in a similar way to the
ANORTHIC box
except that they are given in angstroms. For example, to
generate a box that is 4.0 angstroms wide in x, 1 in y and 0.5
in z we
would use:
<pre>
ORTHOGONAL 2.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.25 0.25
</pre><p><BR>
It is important to note that this volume is related to the
CURRENT view
direction. The VIEW ALONG AXIS command can be used to orient the
picture
prior to carrying out this command if required.
<div class="directive"><strong><i>CUT</i></strong>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>COMPLETE</i></strong>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>CENTROID</i></strong>
As with PACK a further sub-command can be used if desired to
define the
type of boundary handling used. CUT, COMPLETE and CENTROID have
the same
meanings as described above for PACK.
<div class="parameter"><i>INTRA</i>
</div>
<div class="parameter"><i>INTER</i>
</div>
<div class="parameter"><i>KEEP</i>
These sub commands have an identical meaning to those described
for PACK
above.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="17.7">17.7: EXAMPLE</A></H3></CENTER>
<P>To generate all the atoms that lie within a sphere of radius
5.0
angstroms about a CU1 atom we use:
<pre>
ENCLOSURE
ATOM CU1
SPHERE 5.0
CUT
</pre><p><BR>
<P>To generate all the asymmetric units that have any atoms within
a box
of side 0.5 units around the unit cell centre we use:-
<pre>
ENCLOSURE
POINT 0.5 0.5 0.5
ANORTHIC 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25
COMPLETE
</pre><p><BR>
<P>And to generate all the atoms that lie inside a box centred on
the
point 0.25 0.25 0.25 and of sides x=1.0 y=2.0 and z=3.0 angstroms
:-
<pre>
ENCLOSURE
POINT 0.25 0.25 0.25
ORTHOGONAL 0.5 0.5 1.0 1.0 1.5 1.5
CUT
</pre><p><BR>

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="17.8">17.8: PACKING MORE COMPLICATED STRUCTURES</A></H3></CENTER>
<P>The PACK and ENCLOSURE commands always work on the initial data-
unless a SETUNIT command has been issued. In some cases however, it is
more useful for the user to be able to deal with certain sections of the
structure separately. This is most likely to occur where there is more
than one distinct unit in the asymmetric unit. This is dealt with by the
command GROUP.
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>GROUP</u></strong><br>
<P>GROUP can be used directly after both PACK and ENCLOSURE. The syntax
is:-

<pre>
PACK GROUP groupname CELL ...
or
PACK GROUP groupname WINDOW ...
etc
</pre><p><BR>
This causes the groups to be packed individually, the CENTROID,
COMPLETE and CUT commands are applied to the group and not to the
asymmetric unit as a whole. Packs are cumulative, unless a
PACK/ENCLOSURE is done without the GROUP sub command in which case the
previously generated atoms are overwritten. Groups are defined with the
command DEFGROUP.
<P>If required, more than one groupname can be packed at once - they are
all treated separately. All groups can be packed in turn if PACK GROUP *
is used.

<P>This command causes all atoms generated via PACK or ENCLOSURE
to be
removed from the calculations, drawings etc. It has no
sub-commands.
It also works with ADD and MOVE generated data.
