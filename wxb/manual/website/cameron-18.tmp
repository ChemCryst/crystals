<P>The PACK and ENCLOSURE commands already detailed allow the user
to
apply all of the symmetry operators in the spacegroup to the
initial
set of atoms in order to get a fully 'packed' result. In some
cases
however, the user may wish to apply only one symmetry operator
or to
apply ones that are not present in the spacegroup. The ADD and
MOVE
commands allow this.

<P>The ADD command allows the user complete control over the
symmetry
operator used to generate new atoms. The first task of the user
is to
generate a list of those atoms to be used in the symmetry
generation
later. One of the following sub-commands is required :-
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>ATOMS</u></strong><br>
The names of atoms to be included in the pack list are specified
here.
Element names can also be used if required.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>ALL</u></strong><br>
ALL refers to the atoms that are in the current list. If any
atoms
have been generated by previous PACK , ENCLOSURE or ADD commands
then
these will all go into the list.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>INITIAL</u></strong><br>
ADD INITIAL means that the only atoms to go into the ADD list are
those
that were initially input.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>GROUP</u></strong><br>
This is followed by a group name. The group must have been
previously been defined by the command DEFGROUP.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<P>Once the ADD list has been created the user must then supply
the
symmetry operators which will act on the atoms in this list to
generate
the new atoms. The symmetry input is in two parts.
<div class="directive"><strong><i>OPERATOR</i></strong>
The symmetry operator may be input in decimal or fractional form eg
<pre>
x y+1/2 z

-0.333-x -y -z
ETC
</pre><p><BR>
Decimal translations may  come before or after the axis symbol.
The fractions 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, 1/6 and 5/6 are accepted by the

program, but <strong>must</strong> appear <strong>after</strong> the
x/y/z
character. There must be spaces between the three parts but NO
SPACES
within the operator ie
<pre>
X + 1/2 -Y  Z
</pre><p><BR>
will produce an error as it is not possible to tell whether you
mean
X+1/2, -Y, Z or X, +1/2-Y, Z. This strict input syntax is used
to eliminate
any ambiguities.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>TRANS</i></strong>
Translations can also be applied if required. The translations
are
applied in unit cell fractions. The syntax is :-
<pre>
TRANS x y z
</pre><p><BR>
</div>
</div>

To generate an atom at x+1/2 y z from an atom at x y z we can use
<pre>
ADD
ATOMS C1
OPERATOR X+1/2 Y Z
</pre><p><BR>
or we could use
<pre>
ADD
ATOMS C1
TRANS 0.5 0 0
</pre><p><BR>
The OPERATOR and TRANS commands can be used together if required.
We can
apply a symmetry operator followed by a translation. This reduces
the
errors that may occur when trying to combine the two things into
one
symmetry operator.
<BR>
The use of INITIAL versus ALL is illustrated  below. Start with
:-
<pre>
ADD
ALL
TRANS 1 0 0
</pre><p><BR>
which gives us a molecule at x y z and another at x+1 y z.
Follow this with :-
<pre>
ADD
ALL
TRANS 0 1 0
</pre><p><BR>
and we get four molecules, x y z , x+1 y z , x+1 y+1 z and x y+1
z.
Following it with :-
<pre>
ADD
INITIAL
TRANS 0 1 0
</pre><p><BR>
Gives us three molecules, x y z, x+1 y z and x y+1 z.

<P>The syntax for this command is identical to that for ADD.
Therefore
the commands available are :-
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>ATOMS</u></strong><br>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>ALL</u></strong><br>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>GROUP</u></strong><br>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>INITIAL</u></strong><br>
Which must be followed one (or both) of :-
<div class="directive"><strong><i>OPERATOR</i></strong>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>TRANS</i></strong>
<P>The MOVE command applies a symmetry operator and/or a
translation to
all of the atoms held in the list defined by the
ATOMS/ALL/GROUP/INITIAL
commands. Unlike ADD therefore, the same number of atoms are
present at
the beginning and end of the operation.
