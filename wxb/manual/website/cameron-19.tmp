<P>CAMERON allows the user to calculate distances , angles and
torsion angles.

<div class="instruction"><strong><u>DISTANCE</u></strong><br>
<P>In order to perform a distance calculation two atoms lists must be
generated. The first list is used as a 'starting atom' and the second
list is for 'target atoms'. Distances will be calculated between atoms
in separate lists BUT NOT within the lists themselves. The list may be
generated in two ways:-
<pre>
DISTANCE N O
</pre><p><BR>
generates two lists - both of which can all the N and all the O atoms.
In this case N-O, N-N and O-O distances will be found.
<div class="directive"><strong><i>FROM</i></strong>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>TO</i></strong>
These subcommands allow to specify different starting and target atoms.
<pre>
DISTANCE FROM N TO O
</pre><p><BR>
will only calculated N-O distances. Note that the distance arguments may
be either atoms or elements as required.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>RANGE</i></strong>
This sets the minimum and maximum ranges for displayed distances. The
syntax is :-
<pre>
DISTANCE RANGE dmin dmax
</pre><p><BR>
distances are given in angstroms. If only TWO atoms are present in the
atom list then the distance will be outputted irrespective of the range.
However, as the full calculation will be carried out first there may be
a time delay while the calculation proceeds.

<P>The distances output make use of the symmetry operators in order to
find distances within the given range. The starting atom coordinates are
NOT ALTERED but those of the target atoms are. The symmetry operators
(and any suitable translations) are used to move the target atoms
around. The output produced is:-

<pre>
N1_0      O2      2.323
Operator x y z Translations 0 0 1
N1_0      O2_4    1.114
Operator -x y+1/2 -z Translations 0 0 -1
</pre><p><BR>
These show the N1 to O2 distances. The first distance relates to an O2
atom which does not currently exist. The operator and translations shown
can be used with ADD to generate the atom if required. The second
distance is to an atom (O2_4) which does exist. ie. if no pack number is
given for the second atom it is not present in the current list.
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>ANGLE</u></strong><br>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>TORSION</u></strong><br>
<P>These commands are used to find angles and torsion angles between
atoms that are in the current list. They are entered in sets of three
(or four) as required.
