<A NAME="Cameron - How to get started"> </A>
<P>There is a basic 'startup' procedure that can be followed in order to
get a picture on to the screen.
The following steps are required :-
<pre>
1)      Load in a spacegroup if required
2)      Load in the unit cell dimensions
3)      Load in the atomic coordinates
4)      Select an output device
5)      Set the atom drawing style to BALL
6)      Draw a picture
</pre><p><BR>
This can be accomplished with the following commands, which are
illustrated for a compound which has a spacegroup P 21, unit cell
parameters a=6.0, b=7.0, c=8.0, alpha=90, beta=115, gamma=90. The atomic
coordinates are held in a "list5" type file NIGEL.L5.

<P>From here the view direction can be controlled via XROT, YROT, ZROT or
CURSOR. If you require a picture of all the atoms in the unit cell, and the unit cell also displayed,
the commands are :-
