<P>For complicated structures it is sometimes useful to define
GROUPS of
atoms which can be referred to as a whole later. EXCLUDE,
INCLUDE,
COLOUR BONDS etc can all be used with the GROUP sub-command.
</div>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>DEFGROUP</u></strong><br>
<P>This is the main header command and is followed by the name of
the
group. Note that it is not possible to have group names that
begin with
GROUP itself - g1, g2 are valid names but group1, group2 are not.
Up to
twelve characters are allowed to define the group name.
<div class="directive"><strong><i>ATOMS</i></strong>
<P>This is followed by a list of atoms/elements to be included in
the
group.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>GROUP</i></strong>
<P>It is possible to have an atom as a member of up to three
groups at
once. You can therefore add groups into other groups (see Example).
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>FRAGMENT</i></strong>
<P>The user can include atoms in a group by defining a fragment. The
fragment definition requires a single atom. Any atoms joined to it, and
any atoms to those etc are made part of the group.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>DELETE</i></strong>
<P>You can also remove atoms from groups if required.

<P>Consider an molecule that contains a tri-phenyl phosphine. A
use of
the DEFGROUP command would be :-

<pre>
DEFGROUP PHENYL1
ATOMS C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6
DEFGROUP PHENYL2
ATOMS C11 C12 C13 C14 C15 C16
DEFGROUP PHENYL3
ATOMS C21 C22 C23 C24 C35 C36
DEFGROUP PPH3
ATOMS P
GROUP PHENYL1 PHENYL2 PHENYL3
</pre><p><BR>
If you then realise that there are two phosphorus atoms in the
molecule
P1 and P2 you can use :-
<pre>
DEFGROUP PPH3 DELETE P2
</pre><p><BR>
to remove P2 as it is not a member of the tri-phenyl phosphine
group.
<BR>
