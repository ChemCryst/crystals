<A NAME="Cameron - Miscellaneous commands"> </A>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>RESET</u></strong><br>
This command allows the user to begin again without having to exit and 
reload CAMERON. All current flags will be set to their initial states. 
Note that if a CAMERON.INI file is present it will not be obeyed after a
RESET command. The screen will be set to VGA automatically (as on 
startup) if a CAMERON.SRT file is present.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>LOG</u></strong><br>
The LOG command is used to generate a log of the CAMERON session, this
may be OBEYed later if required.
LOG must be followed by a filename. If a file is already in use for a
log file then the log information will be transferred to the new file.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>EDIT</u></strong><br>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>ON</i></strong>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>OFF</i></strong>
This sets the edit option which is used when an error is found in an 
input line. If edit is on (the default) then the user is prompted as 
described in Chapter 1. If not the computer will bleep and put up the 
message "Error: Automatic Abandon", ignore any unexecuted commands and 
wait for a new input line.
</div>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>MENUS</u></strong><br>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>ON</i></strong>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>OFF</i></strong>
The user is able to control the program via push button menus at the 
side of the screen (PC only). These can be turned on or off as required.
When the menus are active the user can input commands as normal by 
typing - they will appear in a box at the bottom of the screen.
</div>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>ISSUE</u></strong><br>
This allows the user to execute a single system command. This command 
should be enclosed in quotes if it is longer than one word or if it 
corresponds to a CAMERON command.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>PRINT</u></strong><br>
This allows the user to print a hardcopy file. The file will be closed 
if it is currently attached to CAMERON via a COPY command. <strong>NOTE</strong> that 
the print job will be very slow - it may be quicker to close down 
CAMERON first.
