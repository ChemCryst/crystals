<P>If required the user is able to hand over control of CAMERON to an
external file. This is particulary useful if a set of operations is to
be carried out on a number of pictures because the file need only be
generated once and then it can be used over and over again. At the
present time CAMERON is able to read files is its own format - ie in
with the same syntax as the commands input at the keyboard - or it can
read a SNOOPI.INI file as output by CRYSTALS. The syntax is :-
<pre>
OBEY nnn.nn
</pre><p><BR>
Note that any commands entered after OBEY (on the same line) are
ignored. This is to allow for possible errors in the OBEY file - errors
will cause the OBEYed file to be closed. OBEY files may themselves
contain the names of other files to be OBEYed.
