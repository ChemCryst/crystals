<P>The user can archive the present structure view on disk or retrieve a
previously archived view from disk. At present only structure views residing
in the same directory as the crfilev2.dsc (the working directory) can be
retrieved. Equally well, views can only be archived in the working directory.
As an alternative to the line commands, the user may choose the commands
that are available in the pull-down menu 'File'.
The following commands are available -
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>ARCHIVE</u></strong><br>
<P>The syntax is:
<pre>
 ARCHIVE "foo.foo"
</pre><p><BR>
<BR>
