<A NAME="Cameron - View direction control"> </A>
<P>One of the most important features of a graphics package is the
ease
with which a required molecular view can be obtained. CAMERON
contains a
large number of options which allow the user to control the view
direction.

<P>Five commands are available to control the view direction by
applying
rotations to the molecule. These rotations are applied
cumulatively -
rotating about the x axis by 20 degrees then by -10 degrees will
result
in an overall rotation of 10 degrees <i>relative</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>starting</i> <i>point.</i>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>XROT</u></strong><br>
<P>This command is used to apply a rotation of n degrees about the

x-axis which lies horizontally across the screen. The syntax is:
<pre>
XROT n
</pre><p><BR>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>YROT</u></strong><br>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>ZROT</u></strong><br>
<P>These two commands are identical to XROT except for the axis
about
which the rotation is carried out. The y-axis lies vertically up
the
screen and the z-axis is perpendicular to the screen.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>ROT</u></strong><br>
<P>This command is a 'shorthand' for the previous three commands
as it
allows you to apply three successive rotations by entering only
one
command. The syntax is :-
<pre>
ROT x y z
</pre><p><BR>
Note that the order of rotation is: rotate about x then y then
z. The
order of rotation is important - YROT 10 XROT 5 ZROT 15 will NOT
produce
the same result as ROT 5 10 15 as the rotation matrices are
non-commutative.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>CURSOR</u></strong><br>
<P>This command allows the user to control rotation with the
cursor keys.
Each time a key is struck a rotation of 5 degrees is applied
about the
relevant axes. After each key stroke the molecule is rotated and
then
re-drawn. To speed up this process the molecule is drawn in line style
during the
CURSOR rotation and is not scaled. The set-up prior to CURSOR is
restored
once rotation is terminated. The keys used are:

<pre>
Rotation about the x-axis

Positive      up arrow
Negative      down arrow

Rotation about the y-axis

Positive      left arrow
Negative      right arrow

Rotation about the z-axis

Positive      Delete key (PC)
Negative      End key (PC)
</pre><p><BR>
Any other key stroke will terminate the CURSOR control and draw
the
resultant picture.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="9.2">9.2: ORIENTATION COMMANDS</A></H3></CENTER>
<P>More specific orientation of the molecule can be achieved by
relating
the view direction to the position of certain atoms within the
picture.
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>PLANE</u></strong><br>
<P>In some cases it is useful to be able to define a PLANE and
then set
the view direction to be perpendicular to it. The syntax of this
command is :-
<pre>
PLANE at1 at2 at3 ...
</pre><p><BR>
At least 3 atoms must be used to define the plane (element names
will
not be accepted). If more than 3 are used then the program
calculates
the best plane through the atoms and projects onto this.
<div class="directive"><strong><i>ALL</i></strong>
PLANE ALL will generated a 'best view' of the current structure.
</div>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>FACE</u></strong><br>
<P>Alternatively you may want to view onto a particular
crystallographic
face of the unit cell. The syntax for this command is:
<pre>
FACE h k l
</pre><p><BR>
where h k and l are the Miller indices of the FACE in question.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>ALONG</u></strong><br>
<P>It is possible to define the view direction as that looking
down an
interatomic direction. The direction is specified by inputting
:-
<pre>
ALONG at1 at2
</pre><p><BR>
As with PLANE atoms not elements must be used as the arguments.
Note
that the view direction is calculated as that looking down the
at1 - at2
direction ie at1 is the closest of the two. The reverse view will
be
obtained by requesting ALONG at2 at1. ALONG also has a
sub-command
associated with it:
<div class="directive"><strong><i>AXIS</i></strong>
<P>It is possible to define the view direction as looking along
a
particular unit cell axis. The syntax of the command is:
<pre>
ALONG AXIS x
</pre><p><BR>
where x is A, B or C.
</div>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>VERTICAL</u></strong><br>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>HORIZONTAL</u></strong><br>
<P>These two commands are similar to ALONG except that the at1 -
at2
direction is oriented up (VERTICAL) or across (HORIZONTAL) the
screen
as required.
<div class="directive"><strong><i>AXIS</i></strong>
<P>The AXIS sub command may be applied to the HORIZONTAL and VERTICAL 
commands. This rotates the diagram around the z axis so that the 
required axis is HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL as specified. This is 
particularly useful when generating hard copy output.
</div>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>BISECT</u></strong><br>
<P>This command requires three arguments, at1 at2 and at3. It will
generate a view direction looking along the bisector of the
at1-at2-at3
angle. The syntax is:
<pre>
BISECT at1 at2 at3
</pre><p><BR>
where at2 is the apex atom.

<div class="instruction"><BR>IVIEW
<P>The 'title' command of this group of commands is VIEW. IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT COMMAND.  This
requires
no arguments as causes a picture to be output to the current
output
device (see SCREEN). The picture is generated according to all
of the
parameters that are set up prior to its use. For example:
<pre>
XROT 10 VIEW
</pre><p><BR>
will rotate the molecule by 10 degrees about x and then draw a
picture.
<pre>
VIEW XROT 10
</pre><p><BR>
would draw the picture first and then carry out the rotation.
This
rotation would not be observed until the next VIEW is entered.
<BR>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>COPY</u></strong><br>
<P>COPY is the equivalent command for hardcopy output. COPY must be
followed by a filename to which the output will be send. HARDCOPY must
have been used prior to this to specify the output type. The filename
may be one that has already been used in the current run of CAMERON in
which case the user is given an option to append the information.
<BR>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>MATRIX</u></strong><br>
This command allows the user to save the current view matrix.
<div class="directive"><strong><i>FILE</i></strong>
This is followed by a filename. If the file exists (and it is of the
correct format) then any matrices contained within it are available and
any matrices stored are appended to the file.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>STORE</i></strong>
This stores the current matrix. It is followed by a piece of text (in
quotes "text") to act as a description for the matrix. On storage a number
is assigned to the matrix which can be used to retrieve it later.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>RETRIEVE</i></strong>
This command obtains a view matrix from the file set up with MATRIX
FILE. This command must be followed by the number of the matrix
required. Note that these matrices depend on the unit cell parameters and
are specific to a particular structure. They may be used for other
structures but this will have very strange results. IF this happens an
operation such as ALONG AXIS C will recalculate a correct matrix.
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>LIST</i></strong>
This outputs a list of the descriptions and numbers of the matrices
currently stored.
<BR>
</div>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>STEREO</u></strong><br>
This generates output in the form of stereo pairs.
<div class="directive"><strong><i>DEGREE</i></strong>
The angle of rotation between the stereo pairs is given by using the 
DEGREE command.
</div>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>NOSTEREO</u></strong><br>
Reverts output back to normal.

<div class="instruction"><strong><u>PHOTO</u></strong><br>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>ON</i></strong>
</div>
<div class="directive"><strong><i>OFF</i></strong>
These commands are used to control the PHOTO facility. VIEW displays the
user with information about the current scale and displays the mouse
cursor once it has finished. PHOTO ON turns off this and waits for a key
press before proceeding. This allows the user to obtain a 'clean' screen
for photographs to be taken.
