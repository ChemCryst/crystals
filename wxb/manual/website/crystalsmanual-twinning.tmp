<P>The terminology in articles on twinning is complicated and sometimes
contradictory, with the same term being used in different contexts by
different authors. We shall use the following terms, based upon
observations made from the <strong>whole</strong> reciprocal lattice.

<P>It is assumed that sufficient reflections are measured to give a
complete coverage of the asymmetric part of the r.l. for at least one
(called the major) component of the twinned crystal.

<div class="instruction"><strong><u>TLQS twins</u></strong><br>
<P>  Some, but possibly not all, of the reflections from the major
component contain contributions from other twin components.  Overlap is
controlled by accidental relationships between cell parameters. If the
relationship is very exact, so that all reflections are overlapped, the
sample is a <strong>pseudo</strong> <strong>TLS</strong> twin.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>TLS twins</u></strong><br>
<P> Every reflection from the major component contains a
constant fractional contribution from other components. The overlap is
controlled by the crystal class rather than accidental relationships
between cell parameters.
<div class="directive"><strong><i>TLS twins - Class I</i></strong>
 Except for the effect of anomalous dispersion, the Laue
symmetry of the diffracion pattern is the same as that of an un-twinned

The analysis of twinned structures is complicated by several issues.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
1. Identification that the crystal is indeed twinned.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>Twinning - Initial clues</u></strong><br>
These may include may include:
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
      a. Evident interpenetrating reciprocal lattices.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
      b. Split reflections, with a varying intensity ratio.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
      c. Systematic absences not conforming to any space group.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
      d. The ratio of intensties of equivalent reflections from
         different samples is not constant.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
Other clues are:
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
      a. Failure to solve the structure from apparently good data.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
      b. Irreducible R factor from seemingly good quality data.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
      c. Inexplicable strong residual peaks in the difference density
         map.

<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>Twinning - Data collection and processing</u></strong><br>
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<P>
     a.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
There is usually no difficulty in collecting data for TLS twins.
For TLQS twins, each observation needs to be tagged to indicate which
twin components (elements) contribute to the observation. This may be
simply computed from the indices if the different lattices have a
more-or-less exact relationship between them, of may need to be assigned
more carefully if the twin obliquity causes only partial overlapping of
some reflections. For doublet spots, it is important that either the
whole doublet is integrated (tag '12'), or the principal component is
separated out (tag '1').
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<P>
      b.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
There may be serious difficulties in determining the space
group. Trial and error may be the only procedure available.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<P>
      c.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
 The space group used for data reduction  (section !elabel!DATAREDUC!)
 and merging may not be
that of the major component. A Space group showing the symmetry of the
twinned diffraction data should be used initially. The correct space group
should be used once data reduction is complete.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>Twinning - Structure solution</u></strong><br>

      In general, structure solution is the major difficulty in working
with twinned crystals.
<P>
      a.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
For TLQS structures, if a substantial number of reflections are
from the major component only, the structure may solve by traditional
methods.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<P>
      b.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
For Class I TLS structures, structure solution is usually
straight forward, the components of the twin differing only by the
effects of anomalous scattering. Such twins (merohedral twins, or
twinning by inversion) can be processed without further reference to this
part of the manual. All that needs to be refined is the Flack
enantiopole parameter. See the main chapter on refinement.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<P>
      c.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
For Class II TLS structures, if the twin ratio is far from 50:50, the
structure may solve by traditional methods.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>Twinning - Structure Refinement</u></strong><br>

      If the space group, trial structure, twin law and reflection
components are known, this is straight forward. The sum of the twin
fractions must be 1.0

<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>Twin Data stored by CRYSTALS</u></strong><br>
<P>
      For a twinned crystal the following equation holds.
<pre>
      Fsq(obs) = v1.Fsq(1) + v2.Fsq(2) ....
</pre><p><BR>
and similarly for F(calc). The v(i) are the volume fractions of the
components contributing to the observation. A Fourier synthesis using /Fobs/ as
coefficient is meaningless, since the phase alpha(calc) will belong to
only one of the components. The terms needed for Fourier and other
calculations are Fcalc(1), alpha(1) Fobs.vol-fract(1), i.e. only that
 contribution to Fo due to the principal element.

<P>
For a twin with two components, each observation may contain a
contribution from each component, or from both. The reflections have to
be 'tagged' to indicate which components are contributing, the ELEMENT
coefficient in LIST 6  (section !elabel!LIST06!)

<P>
For a TLS twin, every observation contains a contribution from both
components (though if it is a systematic absence for one component, the
contribution will be zero). Since the tagging is the same for every
reflection, it can be inserted automatically by CRYSTALS

<P>
For a TLQS twin, some observations will contain a contribution from the
principal component, and some from both components, giving ELEMENT tags
of '1' and '12' respectively. If additional observations have been made
based on the reciprocal lattice of component 2, and are indexed with
respect to lattice 2, they are given the tag '2'. If any of these
also contain a contribution from component 1, the tag will be '21'.

<P>
Example 1. An orthorhombic space group with a~b, twinned by interchange
of 'a' and 'b'. If 'a' is very similar to 'b', every observation 'hkl' will
overlap with  twin component 'khl', and the ELEMENT tag will be '12',
the default. If a systematic absence from element 1 falls on element 2,
the reflection should not be eliminated during data reduction, and will
have the tag '12', even though the contrinbution from 1 is zero.

<P>
Example 2. A monoclinic crystal with 2cCos(beta)/a about 1/3. Twinning
by a 2 fold rotation about 'a' gives a twin law
<pre>
        1   0   0
        0  -1   0
      -1/3  0  -1
</pre><p><BR>
Overlap of reflections from both components will only occur when 'h' =
3n, giving the ELEMENT tag '12'. If the lattice is only sampled at r.l.
points corresponding to the principal indexing, reflections with 'h' <BR>
3n will have the tag '1'.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>Twinning - LISTS affected</u></strong><br>
<pre>
LIST 5  - Parameters: the number of twin elements and their values must be set.
LIST 6  - Reflections: the observed twinned data must be stored as /FOT/, and the
          twin element tags be set.

<div class="instruction"><strong><u>Twin List 5</u></strong><br>
The number of twin elements and their values must be given. Currently,

</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>Twin List 6</u></strong><br>
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
For TLQS twins, the element tags (section !elabel!LIST06!)
really depend upon exact experimental conditions, and should be computed
by the data collection software. If a reflection is entered without a
twin element tag (eg a SHELX HKL 4 file),
CRYSTALS tries to compute the tag from the twin laws
as follows:
<pre>
      h      the index with respect to LIST 1 (cell) and LIST 2 (space group)
             (this is the index in LIST 6)
      T      The twin law matrix.
      n      the nominal index for the twinned reflection.
             n = T.h
      d      the difference between an exact lattice point and the
             generated point.
             n-nint(n)
      s      The length**2 of the difference vector, in A-2.

</pre><p><BR>
<P>If 's' is less than the TWINTOLERANCE given on the LIST 6 MATRIX
directive, the twinned reflection is regarded as falling upon a primary
element reflection, and the element tag is updated to indicate this.
This method is only an approximation, but may help to make otherwise
useless data useable. LIST 13 (section !elabel!LIST13!) will be automatically
 updated to indicate that twinned data are being refined.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<P>a)Analysis was started as untwinned, and the user wishes to convert to
a twinned refinement
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>The twin laws must be entered and CRYSTALS instructed to convert the
reflection list to a twinned list.

<P>c)Data reduction, sorting and merging to be done in CRYSTALS
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<P>
During initial data reduction  (section !elabel!DATAREDUC!) the crystal must 
be given as <strong>untwinned</strong>
in LIST 13 (section !elabel!LIST13!), and the 'space group' should be that of the
Laue Class of the intensity data, so that the symmetry of the data is
preserved. In  general, systematic absences should be preserved, unless
centring of the cell matches for all twin components. Twin elelemt tags
may be provided by an external program, or computed by CRYSTALS.
<P>
If there are special ELEMENT tags, use something like the following:

<pre>
\OPEN HKLI twin.hkl

END
</pre><p><BR>
After initial processing, LIST 13 (section !elabel!LIST13!) should be changed 
to twinned, the
correct space group entered, and the value of the observed structure
factor stored as FOT, the Total or Twinned structure factor. This is
done by a special call to the LIST 6 instruction (which also sets the
TWIN flag in LIST 13).

</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>TWIN LIST 13</u></strong><br>

The keyword TWINNED must be set to YES for structure factor
calculations. Because different components of a twin will probably have
different extinction corrections, refinement of extinction is deprocated
for twins. CRYSTALS prints a warning, then lets you continue at your own 
risk.

If all the element scale factors are refined simultaneously with the
overall scale factor, the calculation will be singular. In general, the
sum of the element scale factors is held at unity. For only two twin
componenets, this can be done in LIST 12 as a constraint. For more, it
can be done in LIST 16 as a restraint. The sum of the elements in input

<P>The Flack parameter is just a short-cut to twinning by inversion. If you have additional twinning, then you have to do it the hard way by including all the twin laws in LIST 25, setting the appropriate ELEMENT flags in LIST 6, and appropriate instructions in LIST 12
<P>
If for example the macroscopic twin law is a reflection in P41, eg (0 1 0,  1 0 0, 0 0 1), then LIST 25 would be

 In a twinned crystal, two or more separate components or  ELEMENTS
 contribute to the diffraction pattern,
 and the observed intensities may
 contain contributions from any one of the possible twin component
 In addition, the amount of each twin component
 present in a specified unit of volume is not restricted, and in
 general will vary between different samples of the same
 material.
<P>
 The expression for an observed intensity in such a case
 is given by :
<pre>
 It = v1*I1 + v2*I2 + . . + vn*In
</pre><p><BR>
 Where  <i>It</i>  is the total observed intensity to which <i>N</i>
 components contribute,  <i>Ii</i>  is the intensity of component  <i>i</i> ,
 and  <i>vi</i>  is the amount of component  <i>i</i>  present in a given
 volume.
 The  <i>vi</i>  are known as the 'component scale factors', and
 are conventionally taken to be
 the amount of the given component present in a unit volume of the
 crystal, so that :
<pre>
 SUM(vi) = 1      over all the components.
</pre><p><BR>
 When a set of reflection data is handled for a twinned crystal,
 it is thus necessary to know which of the possible components
 contribute to the current reflection, and
 to be able to generate the indices
 of each of the components from a set
 of indices given in a standard reference system.
 If the indices of an component in its own reference system are
 given by the vector
  Hc  and those in the standard system by  H , the necessary
 interconversion is given by :
<pre>
 Hc = R.H
</pre><p><BR>
 R  is a rotation matrix that describes the transformation
 of the indices.
 (The generation of the various sets of indices can be thought of
 as a rotation centred on the origin).
 The indices  Hc  are of necessity integers, but the components of
  H  may in general take any value.
<P>The interconversion of atomic coordinates between the various
 reference systems in a twinned crystal can also be expressed
 in terms of  R  :
<pre>
 Hc[T].Xc = H[T].X      for any component.
</pre><p><BR>
 Where  X  is the coordinate vector for any atom in the standard
 reference system,  Xc  is the coordinate vector for the
 same atom in the reference system for one of the components and
  H[T]  indicates  H  transposed.
 The above expression may be rewritten as :
<pre>
 H[T].R[T].Q.X = H[T].X
</pre><p><BR>
 Where  Q  is the matrix that converts the atomic coordinates.
 Therefore :
<pre>
 R[T].Q = I
</pre><p><BR>
 Where  I  is the unit matrix.
 The matrix  Q  is thus given by:
<pre>
 Q = R[TI]
</pre><p><BR>
 Where  R[TI]  indicates  R  transposed and inverted.
 The coordinates therefore transform as :
<pre>
 Xc = R[TI].X
</pre><p><BR>
<P>Before any reflections can be processed, the matrices  R  must
 be provided.
 These are given in LIST 25, which must contain one matrix for
 each possible component.
 (If the standard system is chosen as that of component 1, for example,
 the first  R  matrix will be the unit matrix, which must be given
 as it is not assumed).
