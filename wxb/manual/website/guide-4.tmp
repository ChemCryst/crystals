<P>Fourier summations are computed by the instruction \FOURIER with
 an appropriate keyword. Patterson functions can be computed directly
 from the observed structure amplitudes, Fourier summations require that
 phase angles have been computed previously. This may be done by issuing
 the instruction \SFLS with the directive SCALE or CALCULATE. Remember, if you
 have been doing Least-Squares refinement, that after a new parameter list
 has been generated the structure factors will need recomputing if they are to
 reflect these new parameters.
<P>If the user has not used the SPACEGROUP command, he
 is required to choose for himself that fraction of the unit cell
 which must be computed, and enter this information as a LIST 14. Where there
 are alternative choices possible, computational efficiency is the 
 main factor to be concidered if the map is not going to be printed. 
 If the X-ray intensity data are to the same resolution along all axes, the 
 user should, if the space-group permits, choose an asymmetric volume in 
 the form of a thin 'slab', and use an ORIENT directive to compute sections
 parallel to the slab face to minimise computation time. For example, in
 an orthorhombic  cell 16x11x24, a volume 1/2 x 1/4 x 1 computed in
 3min 27secs, and a volume 1 x 1/2 x 1/4 computed in 1min 40secs.
<P>When the map is to be printed, then convenience in handling the final 
 map is the main consideration. For example, if the structure has an
 essentially
 planar fragment which needs looking at, the sections should be chosen 
 approximately parallel to the plane. Also, though CRYSTALS will compute maps
 with any number of points in each direction, and will split the sections up
 onto several sheets of paper if they are too wide to fit directly, the output
 is clearly more manageable if the user can arrange the width to fit onto
 a single page.
 The fraction of the cell chosen should be such that it contains at 
 least an asymmetric unit, with a small additional border if the user 
 is explicitly defining the volume and grid intervals. Failure to include
 this border may lead to the peak-search routine finding (during the 
 least-squares peak fitting) very large or small peaks several
 Angstroms beyond the edge of the volume computed.
 Such spurious peaks are easily found by inspection, but could be troublesome
 if
 some sort of automatic interpretation of the map was being attempted. When
 the system is allowed to chose its own sampling interval, a border is 
 automatically included, and these spurious peaks seldom occur.
<P>Parameters on the \FOURIER instruction enable the figure
 fields to be scaled and formatted, and the user should well consider
 what precision he requires in the output map. If he is looking for features
 that can be represented to two integer places, and there are other
 previosly characterised features requiring three places, a format permitting
 printing printing of signed two digit integers will be adequate if rho-max
 is set to 99.
<P>The default
 map type is an F-OBS map.
 The peak search routines automatically reject all but one peak 
 from sets of peaks related by a symmetry element. Additionally, if an atoms
 list, LIST 5, is present, the program evaluates the electron density at atomic
 sites. The message 'NOT FOUND IN THE MAP' inevitably means that the user has
 used an inappropriate LIST 14, and has not computed a complete asymmetric
 volume (though he may have computed some part twice!).

<P>Patterson functions are computed by the instruction FOURIER
 with the directive MAP TYPE = FO-PATTERSON.  CRYSTALS 
 automatically modifies the symmetry information taken from  LIST 2 
 into that appropriate for a Patterson map, i.e. includes a centre of symmetry
 and drops the translational components. In some space groups this may lead
 to an origin shift, so that the user will have to 
 input appropriate values in  LIST 14. 
<P>The modified LIST 2 is used for the implied distance-angle calculation called
 by FOURIER to detect degenerate peaks, but it is not written back to the DISK,
 which retains the original LIST 2. If the user wishes to explicitly
 compute distances and angles on the Patterson peaks list, he must include
 the parameter SYMMETRY=PATTERSON in the distance calculation.

<P>Any of the weighting schemes described for LIST 4 can be applied to
 the Patterson coefficients. Unit weights can be  modified using  Scheme 13
 to sharpen the map. The formula of Dunitz (Acta Cryst(1973), B29, 589) 
 should be used with P(1)=1 and P(2)=10 to avoid over-sharpening. The weight
 for a reflection at theta=30 will be 50 for Mo radiation. Do not forget
 you will probably wish to restore the original weighting scheme.

<P>CRYSTALS provides a mechanism for performing elementary Fourier refinement.
 Such a procedure is very cost-effective during the initial development of
 poorly phased structures, such as those based on E-maps or heavy-atom phased 
 maps. At that stage, non-linearities degrade the convergence of simple
 least-squares, though the use of constraints may substantially improve the
 situation (see the section on Least-squares). Fourier refinement has a
 good range of convergence and is relatively insensitive to errors in the
 model, though it does require the atomic sites to be resolved.

<P>In addition to maps computed with /Fo/, /Fc/ or /Fo-Fc/ as coefficients,
 maps can be based on /2*Fo-Fc/. Such maps are commonly used in protein
 crystals structure analysis, and are useful in small structure analyses
 when there is disorder. The reduced contribution from /Fc/ means that
 a diminished image of the 'known' structure is retained in the map, and
 serves as a guide through those features due to /Fo/.

<P>It is rare that the user can use LIST 14 to choose a fraction of his cell 
 so that the resulting map will contain a discrete and connected molecule.
 In general, the peaks taken from the map must have symmetry operators applied 
 to them to generate a unified molecule. This can often be done automatically
 for organic molecules using the instruction \REGROUP. By using \REGROUP with
 different collection ranges, it may be possible to construct a very acceptable
 molecule.

<pre>
 \REGROUP
 \ build up the main frame of non-hydrogens first
 SELECT MOVE=1.6
 END
 \REGROUP
 \ now re-move the hydrogens, important if the 
 \ molecule is crowded or distorted
 SELECT MOVE=1.1
 END
</pre><p><BR>
<P>The REGROUP instruction reorders (and optionally renumbers) LIST 5.
 \COLLECT, which computes connectivity based on radii taken from LIST 29,
 leaves the order of LIST 5 unchanged, but applies any necessary symmetry
 to the coordinates. COLLECT with the parameter TYPE=PEAK is useful for
 moving new found peaks as close as possible to existing atoms.
<P>While the user can often get some idea of the shape of his structure by
 looking at peaks lists and inter-atomic distances and angles, simple line
 diagrams may also be useful. In CRYSTALS, these are obtained via the
 molecular axes (q.v.) calculation \MOLAX. This instruction enables a
 plot
 to be made onto the best plane through a specified list of atoms or peaks.
 The list may include all the items in LIST 5, only selected items, and
 symmetry operators may be introduced if the user thinks that this may
 produce a more interpretable figure. The example below is based on trans-1,4 
 dimethyl cyclohexane, which lies on a centre of symmetry and
 has 4 unique carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms. 

<pre>
 \MOLAX
 \ use the whole of LIST 5, together with its 
 \ image in the centre at 0,0,0

 \ now just look at the methyl group
