<P>Generalised Fourier sections, that is sections not parallel to a cell face,
 are computed by a special program (\SLANT), rather than by interpolation into 
 the normal map. Such maps are useful for detailed examination of special
 problems, such as disorder, poor resolution  or large thermal motion. 
 Features identified in the map can be converted back to crystal coordinates
 for inclusion in the model.
 In spite of special computing techniques, the generalised Fourier
 is about 10 times as slow as the normal Fourier, for which the Beevers-Lipson
 method is used.
<P>The position, orientation and extent of the map must be specified in a 
 consistent coodinate system. This is most conveniently found from a MOLAX
 calculation on atoms or points in the required plane. The required position
 is then the centroid in orthogonal angstrom, and the matrix is the
 transformation from crystals fractions w.r.t. this
 centroid to best plane co-ordinates in Angstrom,
 and the extent is defined by the number of steps and the step lengths
 parallel to XP and YP. There are no formatting parameters available 
 for the instruction \SLANT.
<P>The editor \EDIT can be used to apply the rotation and translation needed
 to transform points back from map to cell coordinates.
