<P>As explained above (Part 4), Fourier techniques provide a powerful way 
 for initiating the refinement of a structure. When the geometry of fragments
 are well known from previous analyses, for example phenyl groups, the initial
 refinement can be speeded even futher by forcing the observed fragment to
 adopt an idealised geometry. This process, common in protein crystallography,
 is known as regularisation, and can be used not only to tidy up a poor
 geometry, but also to postulate sites for missing atoms.

<P>Regularising a cyclopentadienyl ring. The idealised coordinates are from
 the literature.

<P>Completing and regularising a phenyl ring. C(3) is very poorly placed,
 and so will first be deleted, and C(6) has not been found at all. 
 New atoms will be generated for them.

 \EDIT
 DELETE C(3)
 \REGULARISE REPLACE

 BE SURE THAT THE GIVEN ATOMS ARE ALL IN THE SAME MOLECULAR 
 FRAGMENT, OTHERWISE YOU WILL NEED TO GIVE SYMMETRY OPERATORS.
