<P>A special case of regularisation is the computation of the position of
 hydrogen atoms in an organic structure. Unless there is likely to be 
 some ambiguity over the nature of the bonding, there is generally little
 to be gained in searching for hydrogen atoms in difference Fourier maps.
 Instead, their coordinates can (and should) be computed geometrically.
 CRYSTALS has routines for placing sp1, sp2, sp3 and phenyl
 hydrogens, taking proper account of symmetry, bond lengths and angles.

<P>Place the hydrogen atoms on carbons C(2) to C(6) of a phenyl group and
 the two hydrogens on C(31) of an aliphatic chain.

<P>Although the default bond length is suitable for placing hydrogen atoms
 as seen with X-rays, it can be changed to that suitable for neutrons,
 and \HYDROGENS can even be used to place non-hydrogen atoms, such as
 the oxygens in borate groups.
