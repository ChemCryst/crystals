<P>Increasingly, the aim of a crystal structure analysis is not to produce
 a detailed description of a single structure, but either to determine
 the gross structure of a compound, or obtain geometric details of a series
 of compounds.  Few crystallographers now have the time to make friends with
 all their structures. None the less, since most published structures now find
 their way into computer readable data banks, from which they may be retrieved
 by programs with less insight than human researchers, it has become more vital
 than ever that structures are processed in a well defined and documented way,
 and that the results are published without additional errors. CRYSTALS does
 watch what the user is doing, and may alert him to real or potential problems,
 but eventually the user is responsible for his own work. The following list
 gives some of the points to be checked, and the facilities available for
 doing this.

<P>This provides a broad and largely unbiassed view in an intuitatively 
 interpretable form  of the differences between the observed and calculated
 structure factors. An entirely featureless map indicates that the model
 can simulate the observations well, though other models may do almost as
 well, and there may be errors in the data that it would be preferable that
 the model didn't emulate (e.g. temperature factors concealing the need for
 an absorption correction). In any case, since most refinements will be 
 conducted with some sort of weighting of the observations, it is unlikely
 that the map will be without features of any kind. What is important is that
 any features observed can be explained.

<P>For a formally valid least squares refinement, the average value of
 w(Fo-Fc)**2 must be constant for any systematic sectioning of the data. In 
 CRYSTALS the instruction \ANALYSE provides an analysis  by sectioning as
 a function of h, k, l, parity, class, /Fo/ and sign(theta). The entries in
 the column &lt;w(Fo-Fc)**2&gt;  should be approximately constant 
 throughout the table. If this condition is  not satisfied,
 then systematic variations in &lt;(Fo-Fc)&gt;
 as a function of one or more of the sectionings may throw light on serious
 failures in the model. For example, if Fo is less than Fc for strong
 reflections and also for low angle reflections, then an extinction correction
 may be necessary. Systematic variations as a function of index may indicate
 the need for an absorption correction or an anisotropic extinction correction.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="9.3">9.3: Physical reasonableness</A></H3></CENTER>
<P>A refinement which converges to physically unreasonable parameter values
 cannot be regarded as satisfactory. Positional parameters usually need
 translating into molecular parameters before their significance becomes
 apparent. Several translations available in CRYSTALS.
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>\DISTANCES</u></strong><br>
<P>This instruction computes inter and intra atomic distances and angles. All
 necessary symmetry operators are automatically applied to ensure that values
 within the specified limits are generated. The user should check that there
 are no inexplicably short inter molecular contacts, as well as checking the
 ususal bond lengths and angles. The program will also compute e.s.d.s
 from the full covarience matrix (including symmetry effects). The information
 for this is taken from the least squares matrix, and the program will not
 permit this information to be applied to any other LIST 5 than that produced
 be the corresponding round refinement. It is thus fairly important to give
 your atoms systematic names and serial numbers, and to get the list into
 a convenient order AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Even just changing the serial of
 an atom will inhibit the linking of the LIST 5 and the matrix.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>\MOLAX</u></strong><br>
<P>This procedure computes the principal axes of inertia of a group of atoms.
 If they have unit weights or weights derived from their standard deviations,
 then the shortest axis is parallel to the normal to the best plane, and
 the longest is parallel to the best line. 
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>\TORSION</u></strong><br>
<P>This procedure computes the torsion angles for the specified atoms. e.s.d.s
 are not currently computed.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>\CHECK</u></strong><br>
<P>This procedure compares the current values of parameters with those 
 requested in the restraint definitions. Current values differing
 significantly  from those required should be carefully reappraised, since
 they indicate a conflict between the diffraction data and the hypotheses.

<div class="instruction"><strong><u>\AXES</u></strong><br>
<P>The six components of the anisotropic temperature factor can be transformed
 to define a three dimensional ellipsoid representing the harmonic motion of
 the atom. If free refinement of the U's leads to an ellipsoid with a negative
 volume, then the transformation becomes meaningless, usually indicating that
 there are grave deficiencies in the model or the data. For data collected
 at very low temperatures, the volume may go marginally negative, and
 restraints on the U's should stabilise the situation. The procedure AXES
 is called automatically after every round of refinement, to give warning
 of non-positive definite U's. Refinement will however continue even if
 some atoms are unsatisfactory. The result is generally a rapidly diverging
 process with rapidly increasing R factors.
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>\ANISO</u></strong><br>
<P>This procedure tries to fit the atomic temperature factors to a rigid body
 composite temperature factor. This is partitioned into three parts, T
 representing the rectilinear vibration of the body, L representing its
 torsional libration, and S representing the coordination between these two
 parts. There are 20 independant terms to be evaluated in TLS for an
 unsymmetrical fragment not lying on a symmetry operator, so that a rigid
 body of this sort cannot be defined for less than 4 atoms. For a body
 of six atoms, the calculation might just be meaningfull, though there are
 problems with the conditioning of the matrix if the atoms lie close to a conic
 section. Under these conditions the maths cannot distinguish two correlated
 motions in T space from a corresponding libration in L space. The user
 should be aware that good agreement between U(obs) and U(calc) does not mean
 that the values of T, L and S have any physical significance.

<P>CRYSTALS comes with the graphics program Cameron for visualising structures.
