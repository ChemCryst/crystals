<P>The main CRYSTALS documentation is the CRYSTALS REFERENCE MANUAL
(<A HREF="http://www.xtl.ox.ac.uk/crystalsmanual.html">http://www.xtl.ox.ac.uk/crystalsmanual.html</A>), which
 is more or less complete and definitive.
 This Primer gives an introduction to the  main features.
 A more detailed introduction to the program
 is available in the GUIDE (<A HREF="http://www.xtl.ox.ac.uk/guide.html">http://www.xtl.ox.ac.uk/guide.html</A>).

<P>No two crystal structure analyses follow exactly the same path, so
that it is impossible to give a definitive step-by-step procedure for
the general case. The principal causes for deviation from a linear
process are:<BR>
<BR>
- Direct Methods fails to yield a recognisable structure.<BR>
- Direct Methods yields a partial structure<BR>
- Fourier refinement fails to complete the structure<BR>
- There is disorder in the structure<BR>
- There is unexpected solvent (possibly disordered)<BR>
- Difference maps fail to locate all the H atoms, and their positions
   cannot be simply predicted.<BR>
<BR>
<P>Most of these situations can readily be recognised by a chemist with
some crystallographic experience, and so for the moment it is necessary
for some one to remain in control of each structure analysis
<BR>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>Principal Stages of analysis</u></strong><br>

<P>The principal steps in structure analysis are:<BR>
<pre>
Data collection.
Transfer of data from diffractometer to user's computer.
Data pre-processing. This is diffractometer-specific and performed
   with a dedicated program.
Data reduction. This is the Lp and possibly absorption corrections.
   May be included in the pre-processing, or done by CRYSTALS.
Structure Solution. Usually done by direct methods (SIR or SHELXS),
   even for heavy atom structures.
E-map evaluation, usually done by inspection with CRYSTALS/CAMERON.
Structure development. Atoms not revealed by direct methods may be
   revealed by Fourier refinement in CRYSTALS
Structure refinement, by least squares. First isotropic and then
   anisotropic temperature factors for the non-hydrogen atoms.
Hydrogen atom location, from a difference Fourier, by geometric
   prediction, or a combination.
Final refinement, possibly including extinction, final difference
   synthesis, production of tables and diagrams.

<div class="instruction"><strong><u>Using CRYSTALS</u></strong><br>
<P>On any computer, it is recommended to create a dedicated directory
 sub-directory or
 folder for each separate structure. Keep the primary data
from the diffractometer in this folder, together with the files created
during the analysis.

<P>CRYSTALS uses a many files during a structure analysis. Under most
operating systems the user can choose the filenames. Under DOS they are
pre-defined.
<BR>
<div class="parameter"><i>*.DSC</i>
 : The binary database for the structure being refined. DO NOT try
           to edit or print it
</div>
<div class="parameter"><i>*.LOG</i>
: A log of all the data operations done with CRYSTALS. This
file could be renamed and edited for use as an instruction file for a
future job.
</div>
<div class="parameter"><i>*.LIn</i>
: A 132 column listing file recording all the output from CRYSTALS. Under
VMS the name is *.LIS(n).
</div>
<div class="parameter"><i>*.PCH</i>
: 80 column card image file of data for archiving or transfer to other
programs.
</div>
<div class="parameter"><i>INITIAL.*</i>
: Files produced during initial data processing, and perhaps important
when the structure is being written up.
</div>
<div class="parameter"><i>EXPORT.DAT</i>
: A file (optionally) written at the end of every job, containing atom
parameters and refinement directives.
<BR>
</div>
<div class="instruction"><strong><u>Preparations for the analysis</u></strong><br>
<BR>
Before you start using CRYSTALS, you will need to know (or have in a
suitable file) the following:<BR>

<pre>
Unit cell parameters and standard deviations.
Chemical formula.
Space group symbol.
Number of formula units in the unit cell
Crystal colour and approximate size and shape.
Minimum/maximum index ranges during data collection and cell determination.
Minimum/maximum theta ranges during data collection and cell determination.
The name of the file containig the reflection data.

If the data has been preprocessed by some other system, you will also
need to know:
<BR> 
The merging 'R' factor (Rint)

<P>As an introduction to the system, it is assumed that the reflections
have been pre-processed and are in  SHELX  'HKLF 4' format, ie each line
of the file contains h,k,l, Fsq and sigma(Fsq) in fixed columns. You will need
to know the FORMAT of the data (a FORTRAN convention). If the pre-processor
documentation specifies the output format use it, otherwise study the
following example.
If there are decimal points in the numbers, they count as a column but
are not important for the FORMAT statement.<BR>
<pre>
e.g.
      1234567890123456789012345678 (column number)
         1  -2  13  186135   465.4 (reflection 1 -2 13, Fsq=186135, sigma=465.4)
        10   3   0     145      17 (reflection 10 3 0, Fsq=145, sigma=17)

</pre><p><P>The FORTRAN format for this data is:
