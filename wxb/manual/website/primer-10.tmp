<P>Details of the molecular geometry can be computed in CRYSTALS. Most
 calculations send a summary to the screen, and a detailed listing to the
 printer file. Some will also produce a .PCH file (fixed format ASCII) suitable
 for incorporation into publications in either tabular of 'cif' format.

<P>The user has a lot of fine control over the distance-angle routine, which
 should help minimise unwanted output. For many cases the default settings are
 suitable. A text file suitable for editing into documents may also be
 produced

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="10.2">10.2: Best planes, lines and dihedral angles</A></H3></CENTER>
<P>Planes, lines and the angles between them are computed with MOLAX (molecular
 axes). This routine also produces simple plots.

<pre>
      !\MOLAX
      !ATOM FIRST UNTIL LAST
      !PLANE
      !EXEC
      !ATOM C(1) UNTIL C(6) P(1)
      !PLANE
      !EXEC
      !ATOM P(1) FE(1) P(2)
      !LINE
      !ATOM P(3) FE(1) C(17)
      !LINE
      !ANGLE 3 AND 4
      !END
</pre><p><BR>
<P>This task computes the best plane through the whole structure, through a
 P-phenyl group, and lines through two groups of atoms. The corresponding
 vector (plane normal or line axis)
 is stored for each PLANE or LINE calculation. The ANGLE directive
 requests the angle between the 3rd and 4th vectors, i.e. the two lines.
 EXEC, as in EDIT, forces immediate execution of the preceeding directive.

<P>Torsion angles are computed with

<pre>
      !\TORSION
      !ATOM C(1) C(2) C(3) C(4)
      !ATOM C(6) C(7) C(8) C(9) UNTIL C(11)
      !END
</pre><p><BR>
<P>This computes one torsion atom in the first command, and 3 in the second.
 The output can be sent to a text file.

<P>During the course of refinement, CRYSTALS keep a watch on the thermal
 parameters and issues warnings if they go too small or too aspherical.
 However, it is often instructive for the user to examine both the principal
 axes and the TLS molecular motion tensors, in
 association with a Cameron thermal ellipsoid plot.

<pre>
      !\ANISO
      !ATOM FIRST UNTIL LAST
      !AXES
      !EXEC
      !ATOM C(1) UNTIL C(6) P(1)
      !TLS
      !END
</pre><p><BR>
<P>These commands compute the principal axes of all the atoms, and then do a
 TLS analysis on the P-phenyl group. EXEC forces immediate execution of the
 preceeding commands.
