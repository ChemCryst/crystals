<P>Atomic coordinate and structure factor listings are organised to fit onto
 A4 paper or a continuous listing.
 Bond length, angle and torsion angle listings are a continuous
 column, since they will generally need editing. The listings include standard
 deviations, computed from the normal matrix. This is linked internally to
 LIST 5, therefore, LIST 5 MUST NOT BE MODIFIED in any way between the final
 least squares and the generation of publication listings.

  REFLECTIONS, PARAMETERS
 and DISTANCE have a wide range of parameters which can be set to control the
 type and format of the output. The SCRIPT \SCRIPT PUBLISH helps prepare
 tables for publication.
