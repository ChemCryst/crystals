<P>The Crystallographic Information File data format (cif) is gaining popularity
 as a means of submitting numerical data for publication. With <i>Acta</i> Cryst.}
 submission of a cif file with an article can speed up processing of the
 document by several weeks.
 Atomic parameters, bond lengths, angles and torsion angles can be
 out-put in 'cif' format, together with a list of the other data required by
 <i>Acta</i> Cryst}. You are recommended to input a LIST 30 at the very start of an
 analysis, since this will be updated with various 'goodies' as the analysis
 proceeds.
 As above, LIST 5 MUST NOT BE MODIFIED in any way between the final
 least squares and the generation of publication listings.

of cif files.
