<P>The data base is held in the binary file *.DSC, called 'the disk'. This
 file MUST NOT BE PRINTED. It will grow with use, and cannot be shortened.
 Instructions exist for recovering space within the disk. See the section
 DISK for details.

<P>The disk index can be examined with

<P>The data in a CRYSTALS LIST can be examined with:

<pre>
      !\SUMMARY LIST n
      !END
     Which sends a brief summary of LIST n to the terminal
 or
      !\PRINT n
      !END
     Which sends a detailed listing to the .LIS file.

<P>Whenever a LIST is stored in the disk, its serial number is incremented.
 In general, previous lists are over written, but new parameters lists,
 LIST 5, are always created. Previous versions can be made current or
 active by 'resetting' to them. This is done either by giving their
 absolute serial number, or a relative number.


<pre>
      !\DISK
      !RESET       5       0      -1
      !RESET       5      42
      !END
</pre><p><BR>
<P>The first reset steps back one to the previous parameter list. The second
 reset (which of course supersedes the first), makes LIST 5 serial number 42
 the current active version.

<P>The disc file slowly grows as lists are accumulated in it.
 Non-currently
 active lists can be eliminated with the PURGE instruction. Valuable
 intermediate versions of lists, such as a good trial structure before an
 experimental refinement, can retained by setting a flag.

      !\DISK
      !RETAIN 5      17
      !END
