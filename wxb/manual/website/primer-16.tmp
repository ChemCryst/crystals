<P>CRYSTALS was originally conceived as a refinement program, and continuing
 developments have maintained it as one of the best. The following examples
 illustrate some common situations. Remember that  constraints are set in LIST
 12, and restraints in LIST 16. They can be combined in almost any resonable
 fashion. An important principle to remember in building constraints is
 that it is <strong>not</strong> parameters which are refined, but <i>sfifts</i> in
 parameters. Parameters cn be linked to have the same shift, even if the
 staring values are (and will remain) different.

<P>These commands define a single matrix block containing the overall
 scale factor, the positions for
 all atoms, the anisotropic temperature factors for the first group of
 atoms, and isotropic for the second. The command LIST 22 converts the
 symbolic LIST 12 into an internal format, and  checks for
 syntactic consistency. It should always be issued if LIST 12 is complex, so
 that potential errors can be detected before least squares are started. It
 also informs the user of the space
 which will be needed for the matrix in the .DSC file. It is generated
 internally if the user forgets.

<P>The user can refine different groups of parameters is  sucessive refinement
 cycles, by issuing a new LIST 12 command between each cycle. It is also
 possible to define a multi block refinement, a very effective method if the
 blocks are carefully chosen. Each block should contain correlated parameters.
 As a rough guide, the following groups of parameters are in general
 highly correlated and should be refined in the same block if possible :

<pre>
 1.  Temperature factors, scale factors, the extinction  parameter,
     the polarity parameter and the enantiopole parameter.
 2.  Coordinates of bonded atoms.
 3.  Non-orthogonal coordinates of the same atom.
 4.  U(11), U(22) and U(33) of the same atom.
</pre><p><BR>
<P>If it is necessary to split the temperature factors and scale
 factor into different blocks, their interactions must not be neglected
 but be allowed for by using a 'dummy overall isotropic temperature
 factor'.
 In this case, the scale factor and the dummy temperature factor
 must be put into a block of order 2 by themselves, and the program
 will make the appropriate corrections to all the temperature factors.

 temperature factors.

<P>The first command IMPLIES the positions of all atoms. Subsequent commands
 EXPLICITLY refer to parameters, and over ride the implicit definitions. The
 second command
 ties the occupancies of the atoms in dichloromethane. The
 third defines a methyl group with riding hydrogen positions. The fourth,
 which continues onto the next line, ties all the parameters in one group with the
 corresponding parameters in the second. The final equivalence ties the two
 occupancies, but the weight card negates the shift applied to sodium. The
 total of their occupancies is therefore constant.

<P>Initial refinements of large or disordered structures are best done by
 defining groups of atoms with well known geometries as rigid groups. The
 geometry of the groups should first be idealised with \REGULAR. Each atom
 may not occur in more than one group, though restraints can be applied to
 any atoms, in or out of groups.

<P>Four groups are refined together with 4 other atom positions and all
 the anisotropic temperature factors. Each GROUP is given linked
 anisotropic temperature shifts. They do not have to have the same
 starting temperature factor values.

<P>When a structure contains whole groups of highly correlated coordinates,
 for example when a symmetry operator is lowered by generating atoms and
 removing a symmetry operator, the refinement will be unstable. This can often
 be controlled with:

<pre>
      \LIST 16
      LIMIT .1 X
      LIMIT .1 Y
      LIMIT .1 Z
      END
      \LIST 12
      FULL
      COMBINE C(1,X'S) UNTIL C(23)  AND C(101,X'S) UNTIL C(123)
      END
</pre><p><BR>
<P>The LIMIT restraints prevent wild divergence on the first round of least
 squares, and the COMBINE  card combines the parameters from the original
 fragment with those from the generated fragment - see the reference
 Manual.

<P>CRYSTALS permits the refinement of either the Rogers <i>eta</i> or the
Flack <i>x</i> parameter. The Flack parameter is more stable, and has a
physical interpretation throughout its permitted range (0 to 1). Its
refinement seems to be robust against DIFABS treatment, but does require
an extinction correction to be applied if necessary, and may also
require the inclusion of very weak refections. Note that these are often
systematically over-estimated. The listing file for a cycle of
refinement including the Flack parameter contains a list of 'enantiomer
sensitive' reflections. F+ is Fcalc for the current model, F- for the
inverse, and Fo is the observed value. Fo should tend to F+ or F-. If it
is consistently stronger or weaker, suspect the data collection.
<P>If the material is expected to be chirally pure, once the hand has
been determined <i>x</i> should be set to 0.0, and enantio removed from LIST
12 and turned off in LIST 23. If the material is twinned, enantio must
remain in the refinement.

For most space groups the hand of the structure can be inverted simply
by inverting the sign of all the atomic coordinates. For some, the space
group must also be changed, possible with a change in origin.
