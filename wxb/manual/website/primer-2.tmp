<P>CRYSTALS can be run in two modes:
<P>
COMMAND-LINE in which the user enters commands in the order he chooses.
<BR>SCRIPT, in which CRYSTALS tries to help by asking questions.
<BR>
<P>This example will illustrate how to take reflections and a trial
 structure from another system and get them into CRYSTALS, and then
 start  refining the structure. The data is on the distribution media in
 a subdirectory <strong>NKET.</strong>
 You should  create a subdirectory and then copy the data into it.
 The directory NKET contains files for a simple structure determination.
 Some of them are for Command mode, others for Script mode.
