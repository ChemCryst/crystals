<P>The refinable parameters that define the model are kept in LIST 5.
 These consist of atomic parameters, and overall parameters such as
 scale factors and extinction.

<P>CRYSTALS contains no code for direct methods, but can prepare data
 for other programs. It can also submit batch jobs for the other programs.
 SIR and the recompiled version of SHELXS (distributed in CRYSTALS with
 their authors permission) produce atom lists compatible with CRYSTALS.
<P>To create the files in Command mode, issue:

<pre>
      !\FOREIGN  progname
      !END
</pre><p><BR>
<P>To prepare for Direct Methods in SCRIPT mode,  issue:

<pre>
      !\SCRIPT  STRUCTUR
</pre><p><BR>

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="5.2">5.2: Inputting a trial model</A></H3></CENTER>
<P> In interactive mode the files produced
 by the Direct Methods programs may be read into CRYSTALS with

<pre>
      !\SCRIPT  INEMAP
</pre><p><BR>
 The SCRIPT INEMAP can also be used for manual input of coordinates.
<P>If a SCRIPT is not used to input the trial structure,
 the SIR output file can be used as it is, but
 the SHELXS.CRY  file must be edited to standard  CRYSTALS LIST 5 format.

<pre> e.g.
      !\LIST 5
      !READ      NATOM = 3
      !ATOM      C 1 X=.23  .37   .45
      !ATOM      C 2 X=.31  Y=.06 .78
      !ATOM      O 6 OCC=.5 X=0.5  0   .25
      !END
</pre><p><BR>

<P>Note that the parameters x, y, z are in sequence, so only the first keyword is
 requires, and that the parameters for atoms on special positions are not coded
 (as required by SHELX),
 and that there are defaults of 1.0 for occupancies, and 0.05 for Uiso.

<P>The model from SIR may already have some real atom type assigned to each
 peak. SHELXS names all atoms as type 'Q'. The SHELXS.CRY file may be edited
 with a system editor, or the atoms can be edited inside CRYSTALS. In
      Command mode use \EDIT

<pre>
 e.g.
      !\EDIT
      !CHANGE FIRST(TYPE) UNTIL LAST C
      !RENAME C(4) O(1), C(5) N(1)
      !DELETE C(42) UNTIL C(54)   C(17)
      !END
</pre><p><BR>
<P>This sequence changes the type of all atoms (FIRST UNTIL LAST) from
 'Q' to 'C', and then changes C(4) to O(1), etc. deletes atom C(17) and a group
 of atoms.
<P>There is also a SCRIPT to help with editing parameters. \SCRIPT EDLIST5
 guide you through an edit, and \SCRIPT PLOT uses the graphical editor.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="5.4">5.4: Atom identifiers</A></H3></CENTER>
<P>Atom identifiers consist of two parts, a letter string (TYPE)
 which is used
 to associate the atom with atomic properties (form factor, radius etc), and
 a SERIAL
 number in parentheses. The total identifier should be unique for each atom.
 Two special identifiers, FIRST and LAST refer to the first and last atoms in
 the atom list, and must not have serial numbers.
<P>Groups of atoms may be referenced with:

<pre>
      atomid1      UNTIL       atomid2
</pre><p><BR>
 This 'UNTIL' sequence causes the requested operation (detetion in the example
 above) to be performed on all
 the atoms in the atom list (LIST 5) between and including atomid1 and atomid2.
 A thoughtfull naming of the atoms and ordering of the atom list can save
 a lot of typing later. Symmetry operators can also be included in an atom
 specification.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="5.5">5.5: Atom parameter identifiers</A></H3></CENTER>
<P>Atomic parameters are specified in an analogous way. The name of the
 parameter being operated on is included with the atom serial number inside
 the parentheses. The parameter being changed above is TYPE.

<pre>
e.g.
      !BLOCK      C(2,X,Y,Z) UNTIL C(23)
      !BLOCK      C(2,X'S,U'S) UNTIL C(23)
      !BLOCK      U[ISO]
</pre><p><BR>
 The first example specifies
 a least squares matrix block for the x, y and z parameters for
 atoms C(2) until and including C(23). In example 2, the parameters X'S
 and U'S are permitted
 abbreviations for X,Y,Z and similarly for the anisotropic temperature
 factor components. A parameter appearing without an atom identifier
 (U[ISO] in example 3) implies the named parameter for all atoms.
<P>Permitted model parameters are:

<pre>
 Overall parameters
    SCALE OU[ISO] DU[ISO] POLARITY ENANTIO EXTPARAM
 Atomic parameters
    OCC U[ISO] X Y Z U[11] U[22] U[33] U[23] U[13] U[12]
 Abbreviated parameters
    X'S      Indicating  X,Y,Z
    U'S      Indicating  U[11],U[22],U[33],U[23],U[13],U[12]
    UII'S    Indicating  U[11],U[22],U[33]
    UIJ'S    Indicating  U[23],U[13],U[12]
 Special abbreviations
        FIRST
        LAST
        ALL
</pre><p><BR>
<P>Batch, layer and twin scale factors are also permitted.
