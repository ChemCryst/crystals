 This may be the input from SIR etc, from finding additional
 atoms in Fourier maps, or modifying the existing model (with \PEAKS, \EDIT,
 \COLLECT, \REGROUP,
 \REGULARISE, \MOLAX, \HYDROGENS, or \ANISO). These involve operations
 on LIST 5.
<pre>
It is a good idea to assign a final atom numbering scheme as soon as
possible in the analysis. This will save a lot of hastle later.

<P>This command converts the output from a Fourier peak search (held as a
 LIST 10) into a parameter list, LIST 5. It associates any new PEAKS with
 existing atoms. It can also be used for Fourier refinement, and for
 rejecting duplicate atoms, e.g. after changing space group.

<P>These commands assist in assembling molecules from peaks lists. REGROUP
 applies symmetry and
 reorders the atoms in LIST 5, COLLECT only applies symmetry. Both can be
 made to work with all atoms in LIST 5, or only operate on peaks of type
 Q. These are powerful utilities and can save a lot of manual editing.

<pre>
  e.g.
      !\PEAK
      !END
      !\COLLECT
      !SELECT TYPE = PEAK
      !END
      !\SCRIPT PLOT
      !\REGROUP
      !SELECT SEQUENCE=YES
      !END
</pre><p><BR>
 These commands take peaks from the latest Fourier map and
 try to collect atoms of TYPE 'Q' (i.e. new peaks) so
 that they are within bonding distance of existing atoms. The PLOT
 script displays the structure and permits the renaming of peaks and
 atoms, and the exclusion of spurious peaks. REGROUP tries to number the
 atoms so that adjacent ones have sequential serial numbers.

<P>The CRYSTALS editor, \EDIT, is designed to perform crystallograhic
 edits on the atom parameters, in LIST 5. If anything needs to be done
 on groups of atoms, \EDIT is likely to be more convenient than using a text
 editor on the parameter list.

<pre>
  e.g.
     !\EDIT
     !CHANGE    FIRST(U[ISO])  UNTIL  C(10)  .03
     !EXECUTE
     !CHANGE    Si(3,OCC) .667   Si(103,OCC)   .333
     !SUBTRACT  .25 FIRST(Y) UNTIL LAST
     !ADD       C(30,SERIAL) UNTIL LAST 100
     !TRANSFORM -1 0 0, 0 -1 0, 0 0 -1 FIRST UNTIL LAST
     !SELECT    TYPE NE PEAK
     !DELETE    S(14)
     !UEQUIV    C(16) C(23) UNTIL LAST
     !ANISO     Pb(1)
     !KEEP      C(1) C(3) C(5) C(7) UNTIL LAST
     !END

<P>The directive EXECUTE forces immediate execution of preceeding commands. The
 directive CONTINUE is available for building long lines, and QUIT abandons
 the edit without saving the results. The original values are unchanged.

<P>These commands are used to examine the geometry of the model. They can
 also be used to force certain geometries onto the model. MOLAX computes
 best planes and lines (molecular axes), REGULARISE compares and
 regularises structures or structural fragments,
 and ANISO  helps with the analysis of the thermal
 parameters.
