It's always a good idea to keep your data organised, and it will also
help for the purposes of running CRYSTALS.

<P>1. Organise your computer. Create a master folder to
hold all your structures and keep each structure in a sub-folder of this:
e.g. <i>c:\strs\compound1\</i>

<P>2. Copy the crystallographic data in to the sub-folder. CRYSTALS accepts
data files (usuall cif files) from most modern machines, 
and SHELX format .INS/RES and .HKL files.

<BR><strong>Take</strong> <strong>care:</strong> <strong>If</strong> <strong>you</strong> <strong>open</strong> <strong>a</strong> <strong>data</strong> <strong>file</strong> <strong>with</strong> <strong>WORD,</strong>
<strong>you</strong> <strong>may</strong> <strong>accidentally</strong> <strong>save</strong> <strong>it</strong> <strong>as</strong> <strong>a</strong> <strong>WORD</strong> <strong>document.</strong>
Use notepad, EDIT, or some other <i>ASCII</i> text editor.

<P>3. Click the CRYSTALS icon, and use the folder browser to find the
folder containing your data. Click OK.

<P>4. The CRYSTALS window is divided into several areas:
<BR> On the right: <strong>The</strong> <strong>model</strong> <strong>window.</strong> 
This will display the model once the structure is solved.

<BR> Above the model: <strong>The</strong> <strong>model</strong> <strong>toolbar,</strong> lets you change the appearance
and functioning of the model window.

<BR> At the very top: <strong>The</strong> <strong>menu</strong> <strong>bar.</strong> The pull down menus represent
the principal stages of structure analysis, working from left to right.

<BR> Below that: <strong>The</strong> <strong>main</strong> <strong>toolbar,</strong> provides quick access to some
common options that should also be in the menus.

<BR> On the upper left:<strong>The</strong> <strong>text</strong> <strong>output</strong> <strong>window.</strong> This
displays the results of calculations, or asks the user questions.
It has a large scroll-back capability.

<BR> Below that: <strong>The</strong> <strong>information</strong> <strong>tabs.</strong> This panel can be hidden away,
as can the toolbars, by clicking the little triangles in the bar that
divides them from their neighbouring elements.

<BR> And below that: <strong>The</strong> <strong>text</strong> <strong>input</strong> <strong>line.</strong> This is below the
output window. The cursor automatically moves to this area when you type.
The 'arrow' keys enable you to recover previous input (like the DOSKEY
utility). If you are a new user, you shouldn't worry too much about
the text input line.

<BR> At the very bottom: <strong>A</strong> <strong>status</strong> <strong>bar.</strong> Shows progress during long
calculations, and status as CRYSTALS is doing different things.

<P>5. CRYSTALS creates many files:
<BR> <strong>A</strong> <strong>binary</strong> <strong>database</strong> for each structure,
always named CRFILEV2.DSC. <strong>NEVER</strong> <strong>try</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>edit</strong> <strong>this</strong> <strong>file.</strong> This
file enables CRYSTALS jobs to be restarted from where they were left
off. All other files may be opened with a text editor e.g.
notepad, wordpad, or edit.
<BR> Double clicking on the .DSC file will start CRYSTALS in that folder, using
that .DSC file.
<BR> <strong>Text</strong> <strong>files</strong> bfile.l<i>nn</i> and bfile.m<i>nn.</i> The number <i>nn</i>
is automatically incremented with each run of the program. These files can
generally be deleted without looking at them unless the analysis begins to go
wrong. They provide post-mortem information.
The currently in use files may be opened quickly using the "Files" tab on the
information panel.
<BR> <strong>PUBLISH.*</strong> files. These are final listings for preparing papers.
