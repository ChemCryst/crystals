<P> It is best to import the .INS or .RES file first. You can import
a file with or without atoms depending on where the data is from - CRYSTALS
will just grab all the information that it can.
<BR> From the X-ray data menu, choose "Import SHELX file". You will need
to know the space group symbol since this information is not
present in the SHELX file format.
<BR> Type in the file name, or find it using "Browse", click OK and the file
will be imported. (You will be asked for the spacegroup).
<BR> Next import the reflection file. Choose "X-ray data"-&gt;"Import reflections".
The default settings are for a SHELX hkl file, so just type or browse
for the required file, and click OK.

A description of the relationship between CRYSTALS and SHELX commands, 
including examples of their use, can be found on the menu bar under:
